7#=F<DWDWDWDWDWDetDDDDDDDExDF F#Fa*FDWFaF<%FaFaF,FaFaFaFaFaFaChapter 1: HomecomingWrapping my fingers around the brass knob, I twisted and pushed; the door swung open with a slow, aching creak. In the next moment, I was in our childhood living room again, brilliant with sunlight through white gauze curtains. Here was the rug my big sister had woven as a fourth grader; there the oil portraits of my parents I'd attempted as a high schooler. Our plastic ponies stood on top an old record player Father had built himself and fit into an alligator-skin suitcase. Talking and laughing both at once, the old man approached me through the dining room. After five years, his gray beard was still peppered with black and his face still smooth. His grizzled pate was bald on top, his belly round and his limbs muscular.My mother, a tiny woman at four feet eleven stood off to the side with her thick black hair hanging loose about the shoulders. She wore the prized ink blue silk dress from her student days forty years ago in China. Clasping her hands together, she smiled a little girl's smile and probably said something, but as with my father, I could at first not hear a word."Lai, lai, lai" were the syllables to pierce my cocoon of nostalgia; Mother was calling me to come, come, come back into the heart of their home. With some difficulty, I slid the massive pack off my back and eased it onto the wooden floor. "What happened to that?" asked my father.Having survived the test of deserts and mountains, a shoulder strap had snapped as I'd emerged from the local bus depot to walk out onto the quiet streets of Sunday morning. "Nothing," I replied."Always busting things," he commented with a knowing shake of his head. "Just like when you were a kid. Could never take care of your possessions."The sound of Mandarin after four years of almost exclusive English was pure music to my ears. "Never mind," he said with a chuckle. "I'll fix it. I'll fix it!"My mother led me into the kitchen, gleefully opening the oven door to reveal my favorite cookies and snacks abundantly shelved on the roasting racks. I felt nothing of the man returned from halfway around the globe, rather a little boy come back from the neighborhood playground. Father sat me down at the table and poured a glass of cold beer while Mother busied herself with chopping up chicken and long fragrant scallions, red roast pork and soft white bean curd. "I hope you ate well in Australia," she said almost matter-of-factly."He ate well," reassured my father. "Why, look at the boy! Sturdy and plump.""Lean," I corrected him."How about just plain 'sturdy'," suggested Father, and Mother began to laugh.She cooked up eight scrumptious dishes, but the meal was magnificent for the simple fact that we were sharing it. For dessert Father brought out a steaming apple pie that he himself had made from scratch. "To the new Ph.D.!" he said proudly. "To our triumph and victory!"I wasn't "doctorized", not yet at least. I'd left university immediately after submitting my dissertation. Review would take months, so I'd caught a night train from Adelaide, where I'd spent my graduate tenure, to Melbourne. After two more days, I boarded a flight and for the next couple of months toured the Pacific, finally returning to Pennsylvania on the threshold of spring.After lunch, as I washed dishes, my mother mentioned that she was scheduled for surgery that week. During an examination a few days earlier, the family doctor had discovered an abdominal hardening, which tests had revealed as a fibrous uterus. Quite benign.The remainder of the afternoon was spent strolling with my parents. We went to the university ceramics studio, where they collaborated on pottery. We went to the library, where they read Chinese newspapers. We went to the municipal senior citizen center, where they took their lunch and played bridge. We returned home to their garden, where they tended to a riot of flowers. A guided tour of their life together.During surgery, the doctors found a cancerous ovary hidden behind a normal uterus. They also found forty to fifty grapes of cancer spread over the large intestines. They removed the ovary, but didn't know what to do about the colon. In the end, they closed her incision and came out of the operating room to inform us.In the blink of an eye, April's vivid colors turned to shades of gray, and the sun's rays lost their warmth. I knew my father was drowning too, and that my sister in California wouldn't be safe for long. Though three years my senior, she was more emotionally dependent on our parents, so I realized the distance would not spare her and maybe even make things worse.  Drowning in the dark. I did my best to comfort and reassure Father and to receive the comforting of our family doctor, which couldn't be avoided.When I phoned my sister that evening and told her the outcome, she asked me, "What are you going to do?" Less a question than a plea. But then she said, "Why didn't you get a second opinion?""The ... the gynecologist ," I faltered, "wanted to operate before going on vacation. There wasn't time to get a second opinio."It was only in the hours immediately following surgery that I had finally consulted medical texts, which revealed that disturbance of cancer without its removal often stimulated its growth and spread.  Our family doctor confirmed that Mother was now in even greater danger than before. That the uterus had obscured the diseased ovary in x-rays and ultrasound scans, that the grapes of cancer were individually too small to be detected by the hands of a doctor, that this sort of case was a rare occurence was no excuse for either us or the gynecologist. Had we only been aware of potential dangers, she could have been treated at a major medical center, one with surgeons capable of coping with the unexpected, surgeons competent to cut out the cancer as they discovered it. Ultimately, the person to blame was me."So what are we going to do now?" asked my sister plaintively."I don't know," I answered, and there the matter rested.That evening I answered a classifieds ad in the local newspaper and bought a used car with front seats that reclined to an almost horizontal position. The following evening I fetched Mother home to convalesce. A week and a half later, when a gap appeared in her incision from which oozed dark pus, we rushed her back to hospital. The emergency room surgeon told us to move her without delay to Hannover Center, a big research hospital near Bitterfield, but no ambulance could be engaged on such short notice for the long trip.  So I wrapped Mother in a thick, silk quilt and had her lay on the makeshift bed of the car's front passenger's seat.As we drove through the early morning darkness, Mother slept fitfully.  We stopped several times for her to get out and vomit. Twenty miles to Bitterfield, a policeman on a motorcycle pulled us over to ticket me for wearing headphones. The loud music drilling into my brain had kept me awake, but apparently this was illegal. We checked Mother into the medical center at three o'clock in the morning. Afterwards, Father and I drove around town until we found a motel whose manager could be roused.It was our eighth day at Bitterfield, and Father slouched in the cushioned chair in Mother's room. He was fast asleep. Mother, her eyes shut tight, sat up in bed tossing tiny pills of folded paper onto her lap. Her hair hung in a dense single braid over her shoulder. Beneath her silk robe, the color of flame and embroidered in gold thread, was a patient's smock of surgeon green.  "Guang-yu?" she said picking up one of the paper pills."Yes?" I responded.She turned to me, opening her eyes and smiling. "Will you stay with me until I'm better?" "Of course," I answered.She began to unfold her chosen paper pill. "Your father's spirited, but old. It may take a few months, but just this once we'll need your help. Then for the rest of your life, you'll be free."Though Father's mouth was open and he usually snored, this day he slept quietly. His pants of thick denim and shirt of fine gray wool were appropriate to the room's cool climate."I don't mind," I said. The paper pill was completely unfolded now, so Mother pressed it flat between her palms. "He's a decent cook," she muttered, "but I can't imagine that he'd be very good at taking care of a sick person." Squinting to decipher the minute characters she'd somehow managed to write on the paper, she abruptly lifted her head and cried, "Ohhh! You're going to pass your Ph.D. review with distinctions! You're going to be a great success wherever you go, and you're going meet a fine young woman!""So what did the other pill say? That I would end up ... robbing a bank? Get hauled off to prison?"Mother frowned. "Don't say that, even in jest.""Why not? Would you stop liking a convict?"***She waved off my ridiculous notion and turned away to chant a lucky phrase for warding off any evil that might come of such teasing. In the presence of this impishly superstitious woman, the years I'd been away, the miles I'd covered, the oceans I'd crossed, the mountains of work I'd reduced, the hours of solitude I'd logged in the office, the hours of solitude I'd logged in the desert, the people I'd met, the people I'd laughed with and fought with, the beer and wine and liquor I'd downed, the meals I'd burnt on the stove, the everything I'd done in going from the boy who'd left home to the man returned, all this and even more became strangely irrelevant. I thought back to further than the point of departure, to when I was three years old, to when she used to sit me on her lap and put a crayon in my hand. Guiding my strokes and the meandering path of the crayon's waxy tip on paper, the two of us together conjured elephants and giraffes, tigers and dragons."What was it like for you as a child?" I asked. "My family," she said, "was large and complicated.""Yes?"She considered my father still slumbering in the chair. "Very different from his. We were rich, with winter homes in the two great cities of Sichuan provinceChengdu and Chongqing. Our summers were spent on a sugar plantation near Zi Liu Jing, which was something of a miracle. Its salt water wells were naturally iodized, you see; protected the people from thyroid problems, cretinism, which is prevalent throughout the southwestern mountains." She grinned mischievously and indicated her husband with a nod. "His home province Guizhou is renowned for cretins." Undoubtedly so. I smiled too."I was the first-born," she said drawing a quick breath. "After me, there came a long gap of several years, so my mother persuaded my father to take two maids for wives as well. She wanted him to have sons. Apparently it took some doing to win him over to the idea, but he finally came around. And the next child born, which was to my youngest mother, did turn out to be a boy. After that, my own mother had one more daughter and a son. My other mothers between them had four more sons and three daughters. Out of all of these children, my very first brother remained forever my favorite. We were inseparable. I was his protector."Mother climbed out of bed and began walking around the room while clapping hands to the beat of her stepsan exercise she'd learned at senior center. "I can remember one bright day during the summer of my fifth year. We were at the plantation. I and some workers' children had been down by the broad river watching the fishermen work their wide nets. Wearying, I decided to go home first. When I'd broken clear of the woods not far from our estate, I saw a cloud of dust rising in the distance. Soon three horsemen could be distinguished galloping up the road."Even though my feet were sore from the morning's adventure and I was rather small, not at all strong, I sprinted all the way home.  Rushing through the front gate into the main courtyard I shouted at the top of my lungs, 'Bandits!  Bandits! Coming up the road!' And I pushed shut the gates and had two manservants lock them with a great wooden bolt as thick as ... well, as thick I was at the time."When my mother and her attendants arrived on the scene, she asked, 'What's this?' and I explained that we were under siege by brigands. Perhaps she doubted me, but if so, she didn't order the gate unbolted. She simply stood her ground, surrounded by her maids and servants, waiting to see what would come next. "Not long after that, there came a booming knock upon the gate. Nobody said a word. Then another thunderous knock. 'Who is it?' cried the Mistress of the House. And much to my surprise, one of the brigands called out, 'Zeng-ni!'my mother's name. Her face lit up with the biggest smile I'd ever seen her smile, and she moved towards the gate to unbolt it herself, several men rushing to her aid. "'No,' I cried and sprang at her like a lion cub. With all my might, I pulled at her robe. I thought she'd gone mad! Mother, suddenly annoyed, told somebody to pull me off. I let go and raced inside to search out a hiding place, which I found in the kitchen: a giant ceramic urn half-filled with rice."The patient stopped moving her hands and wrapped her arms around herself, as though chilled. She stood next to my slumbering father and looked out the window at the dark woods and purple twilight sky. She seemed to be seeing again, the bolted gate of her family estate, the maids and manservants gathered around her mother in anxious expectation as there came a knocking against the door."It was not until later that evening, when Mother had explained to me who exactly had come that I allowed myself to be led to his chamber. He was still in uniform and very short in stature. Of course, for a tiny five-year-old he might have seemed a giant had I no grounds for comparison, but I could clearly see that my mother stood a full head taller. Years later he would become known as 'the Short General'. On that day, however, at that moment as he drew close to me, I saw that his eyes were gentle, not fierce in the slightest. He stooped down to pick me up, I punched his two cheeks!" The tiny woman laughed softly to herself."It wasn't that he'd stayed away too long; honestly, at that point, I would have been perfectly content had he stayed away forever. In my opinion, we were quite happy on our own!... I hit him because of the fright he'd given me that morning.  Because of the embarrassment I'd been forced to suffer as a result!"The story teller shook her head and frowned, but there was no concealing her pride. "He was a newly-commissioned lieutenant-major," she pronounced, "of the revolutionary army slowly gathering like a great storm far to the south in Canton city. He'd left us before I was even a year old, and all that time he'd been learning to be a soldier."  She laughed again and then fell silent. "Ma?" I said softly, but she seemed not to hear.She carefully pressed down on her silk robe and sighed. Then in an unexpectedly loud voice, she concluded "He became the Marshal of Western Sichuan, with hundreds of thousands under his command and a reputation for extraordinary courage!  Guang-yu, if ever the country should call you, if ever you should go to war, you must remember ... fear not death." She shook her head.  "Fear it not." There Mother stopped, and she seemed strangely solemn.  After a moment longer, she went back to writing tiny fortunes on scraps of paper.Two Skies     vEPSON USB Scanner Class Driver must be present in the Extensions folder to use the EPSON USBuy{8@8G<<=======@P@gY4K@Uf>~@345^x : !!b"#[##''''*-*L,-].013R468Z89;?;q=#p@P #p@P #p@P H=======,Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C#8p@$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@<=K)L1;"<PA@P@P@}Pa@=== !U/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH@Rd(Xd=/B@H-:StyleWriter IINew YorkTimesCourierF0( ,Desktop PublishingDesktop Publishing

7#$B_E%JWJWQQQQRGRGRGRSRcRsRsRxRGSu SW*WQWSWW^,WWWWWWChapter 2: Story Telling"On the day she was born," said my father, his fine spirits on that April morning manifest in the strength and resonance of his voice, "her father decided she must die."Mother was also optimistic and cheerful as her latest diagnosis had been favorable. The soft light of the early-spring sun shone in through the hospital room's large windows."The people," said Father, "called the old man Tai Gong, which was a title of reverence. He had survived five decades and the better part of a sixth. And at a great age had added a new member--a ninth child--to his brood. In the mountains of Guizhou, poverty seldom allowed men to live to an advanced age unbroken."The storyteller sat in the cushioned chair , and the patient stood beside her bed. Mother repeatedly raised her hands to shoulder level and swung them down again, counting silently to herself, "One, two, three. One, two, three." Her favorite calisthenics."But Tai Gong's longevity," continued Father, "was precisely what made him feel the necessity of sacrificing his new daughter. It tormented him to think that death was biding its time outside his chamber door, that it might call for him at any moment. Afterall, what would happen to the girl if he died before she could be married off? Would she be sold?  Perhaps to a brothel?  And how many years did whores last?  Once diseased, she would be cast out to wander the alleys and rot on her own time. Life in old China meant survival.  Life meant forestalling death for as long as possible. To kill her now was the kindest thing he could think to do."Tai Gong asked his eldest son's wife, a small and unusually able woman, to come to him in his chamber. There he presented her with the infant, wrapped in a blanket, and told her to throw the bundle into the river."The daughter-in-law agreed and took the baby away. But she returned so soon afterwards that the old man grew suspicious.  Sensing his doubt, the woman produced the worn, cotton blanket from her bag, laid it on her father-in-law's lap and whispered, 'I've thrown her into the river, Tai Gong. Now she's dead.' To this the old man could find no reply, and the moment passed without another word."Father stopped talking. His hands, which had been executing intricate gestures, became still. It wasn't long though before a smile reappeared on his face. His knees began again to sway from side to side like metronome wands keeping time.  His fingers came back to life. "Three years later," he resumed, "on Tai Gong's sixtieth birthday, all his sons and daughters, sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, along with a horde of grandchildren, gathered at his house for the celebration."Tai Gong felt happy and sat down to count his grandchildren. He suddenly came upon an unfamiliar face. A three year old girl. An extra grandchild?!... He turned to his own children and said, 'Who's this?  I've never seen her before. Which one of you does she belong to?'"Tai Gong's eldest son's wife stepped forward and happily announced, 'Why, she belongs to you.'"Tai Gong turned red. 'To me?' he said. 'What do you mean?'"'Don't you remember?' cajoled the clever woman, 'Three years ago, on the day she was born, you handed her to me and told me to drown her in the river. Well, I brought her home instead and raised her as one of my own. Now she's three years old, and it's your sixtieth birthday. So I've brought her back to you.'"At first, the old man was embarrassed. He became confused and agitated. He looked from his daughter-in-law to his wife and then let his gaze wander out over the small crowd.  Finally, he turned his attention back to the new child. She was pretty and well behaved. She was as fresh and open as he was old and cynical.  Without his even being aware of it, gladness stole back into his heart, and Tai Gong accepted the little girl.  He even liked the unimaginative name his daughter-in- law had picked for her--Man-niang, "graceful girl"--and so he kept that as well."Man-niang lived at home until one month after her fifteenth birthday at which time she was married to a boy named Zhou Jin-cheng, who was also fifteen. This boy was your great grandfather. My father's father."Besides the immediate family, there was no one else outside of China. My sister and I had never known cousins, never called anybody 'aunt' or 'uncle'. Could we actually have had great grandparents? I found myself looking at my palms, in which Mother had once read my fate.  I wondered which lines and what lengths dictated that a person would die before he really had a chance to live or would live for a hundred years. Cupping my hands together, I asked Father, "How old are you?" "Me?" he replied, raising his brows and stroking his full beard.  "Why ...  I don't know." "Eighty-one," I answered my own question."No," said Father grinning broadly. "Impossible!" "As a new born you shared a cradle with your younger cousin, that old woman we saw in Guiyang a few years back.  Then she was seventy-six; this year she's eighty-one. Which makes you eighty-one as well or maybe even pushing eighty-two." "Nooo," chided Mother, momentarily stopping her hand-throwing. "Let your father tell his story!" But Father was too busy chuckling to take up the telling again precisely at that moment.I turned my head to look out the spotless windows.  The spring was indeed coming in. The muddy field beyond the vast hospital parking lot was streaked with the straw and light green of dead and reviving grass; the tall elms beyond the field boasted hundreds of tiny buds.A surgeon entered the room followed by a retinue of lesser surgeons and medical school residents. They all wore cotton lab coats, white and spotless."Hello," said the chief physician, who was a slim, middle-aged man with dark hair and olive skin. His patent leather shoes were so shiny that they reflected his chin, and the small plastic placard pinned to his breast pocket read "Dr. Belamy". In a pronounced Italian accent he continued, "And how are you feeling this morning, Mrs. Zhou?"Mother smiled shyly at the team of doctors and then glanced uncertainly at Father and me."No, no," said Dr. Belamy, shaking his head. "We're not here to examine you; they needn't go.  We're only here for a visit." He turned to his retinue and, in a subdued monotone, delivered an update on the patient's medical status.  One of the young doctors was a chubby, balding man with a thick neck. His complexion was pale and pasty, his mustache thin. This was the Cuban-born Dr. Bravo. Close to him was Dr. Wong, whose round face and delicate features called to mind stone Buddhas and their expressions of indifference.At the conclusion of the briefing, Dr. Belamy turned once more to his patient and smiled urbanely. Mother smiled back guardedly.  Stepping forward, Dr. Bravo said in flawless American English, "Your progress is splendid.  Your general appearance and condition couldn't be better."Mother smiled, clasped her hands together in front of her stomach and looked over the group as a kindly teacher might her pupils. "You are all good doctors," she said in measured, barely intelligible English.  Then she blinked her eyes and nodded. The physicians looked to one another, exchanging sheepishly gratified smiles.  As though on cue, they exited the ward in a group.  Once left alone, we returned to waiting. Waiting for Mother's incision to heal from her first surgery. Waiting for the nurse to bring Mother's lunch. Waiting for the light green buds on the trees to turn into leaves. Waiting for the next surgery.I gravitated toward the window, and Mother walked around her bed to stand beside me and stroke my hair as she has done for as long as I can remember. Unlike hers, my hair is not so black that sunshine seems sometimes to disappear in it. Not so soft as to be as yielding as a breeze. That year she was sixty-three, and I was twenty-five.Father and I were in the wide foyer of the obstetrics/gynecology ward, sitting on a sofa before an expansive curved window. Outside, a parking lot full of cars could be seen through the bare branches of a row of trees. Beyond the parking lot was a busy highway, and beyond that a few stores and restaurants."Six days after the marriage of Man-niang and Zhou Jin-cheng," said Father, "Great Great Grandmother went to visit them in their new home, which was a one-room flat near the heart of town."I listened to Father's narrative as I might have listened to the radio. I heard what he said and even registered its meaning, but my mind was really far away.I stood before a brackish pool in the middle of the central Australian desert, where I had done my graduate research. It had been weeks since I'd last bathed. A dead magpie floated on the water. Close to the narrow shore rested the two halves of a sun-mummified dingo corpse. Fifty feet further stood a lone dingo pup.  It had mange, and I could tell by its labored panting that the end was near. Flies gathered around the corners of my eyes much as I and the baby dingo were drawn toward the fetid pool. The pup's bony image shimmered in the one-hundred-and-thirty-degree heat like an appalling mirage.Next I was driving my land cruiser over a surface of small purple rocks. To either side were long, straight ridges of bright orange sand.  The leaves of the dwarf trees sprouting along the bottoms of the dunes were milky green. The sky was a flawless, infinite expanse of blue.With the dusty approach of my vehicle, hundreds of pink-breasted, gray-winged cockatoos lifted into the air.  The clear waters of the oasis were now in plain sight. The cockatoos circled above me twice, but they must have sensed that I was in no hurry to leave, for the magic carpet of fluttering wings soon descended to the ground again a few hundred feet to the west.  As the cockatoos waited their turn on purple stones, I stripped and waded naked into the transparent pool.There was a faint chuckle, and I was back in the hospital foyer. Father sat next to me, apparently elaborating on something that had happened long ago in a poor town in the mountains. "Great Great Grandmother's feet were bound. No bigger than peaches!" He held his fingers apart to show me just how small and shook his head with a grimace. "She hobbled down the narrow alleyway and, upon reaching her daughter's door, found it ajar.  She called out, 'Man- niang!', but no one answered.  At that point, the giddy joy she felt gave way to surprise and bewilderment, then to apprehension. As she slowly pushed the door open, she was greeted by the sound of sobbing.  She hurried in to find her daughter and son-in-law lying on the cold stone floor before their bed, crying as though their hearts had burst."'Why the tears?' asked Great Great Grandmother. 'What for? It's been just six days; you shouldn't be crying yet.  Marriage is trouble, yes.  To some, even a death of sorts.  But not right away. Not until later. Three days? You should still be laughing!" "Crying?" I said.In a weepy voice Father said, "'We're crying because we haven't eaten all day. We haven't eaten in three days! Not since the wedding banquet, not since the rice Mother Zhou gave us ran out.' Great Great Grandmother suddenly understood.  The groom's family had provided rent for the first few weeks and rice for the first few meals, but of the rest of it, they'd washed their hands. Just at the juncture of that first visit, at the moment of Great Great Grandmother's knock on the door, Man-niang and her boy husband had been discussing their only remaining option." "Which was?" I asked."Suicide," answered Father.I considered this for but a moment before venturing, "Shame?""Of course," said Father."But I can't believe it," I said. "I mean, Jin-cheng must have known he could find something to do to support himself and Man-niang.""But that's just the point," said Father with a snort. "He couldn't do anything. He hadn't attended graduate school." The old man began to laugh."Let's return to Mother's room," I suggested."Okay."We rose from the sofa and started back.  Except for a few words like "okay", our conversations were conducted exclusively in Chinese. Not the lilting Mandarin of Beijing but the flat dialect of the southwestern mountains. Ironically, the people of Guizhou, Father's home province, are known for reticence and sardonic wit, not unlike our New Englanders. And the people of Sichuan, home to my soft-spoken mother, have a reputation for peppery, rambling discourse.The hospital corridor resembled a retiree's highway. We and most patients chugged along at a leisurely pace, while nurses and medical technicians moved at the legal speed limit and occasionally much in excess."Are you going to look for a teaching job when you get to California?" asked Father."No," I replied."Then why did you spend all that time earning a Ph.D.?" he said forcefully."The Ph.D.," I countered with a steady voice, "was your idea," .Father chuckled mockingly and shook his head."Besides," I said, "I don't have a Ph.D. yet. Even though the dissertation's under review, that doesn't mean it's necessarily going to pass.""But will it pass?""My advisers say it will, but who knows?" I shrugged.  "Nobody ever did what I tried to do, and I wasn't ... entirely successful."Father snorted. "Who are the referees?"I glanced at a nurse jogging past carrying a small plastic case, possibly containing a piece of life-sustaining apparatus. "Two of the best in the world." Doing something nobody had ever done before: couldn't that serve as sort of a definition for Ph.D. research--unique but trivial? Father retreated momentarily into his private thoughts before abruptly resuming, "Then will you be able to find work in California?" "Probably," I answered in a voice so low that I wondered if he'd even heard.Again, he became pensive, and we walked through the corridors, our feet carrying us on a trek so familiar by this point that they needed no conscious guidance. As we went by open doors, I peeked inside to see patients watching television, family members sitting in chairs. A few yards before Mother's door, Father suddenly pulled me to a stop ."Hm," he said, this time quietly, with a curl at the corners of his lips. "You were always this way. Soft. Not tough enough. Ever since you were little and your mother coddled and spoilt you. Sometimes I regret having let her talk me out of sending you away to boarding school, where you would have either risen to the occasion or not survived. Better that way. It requires a hot fire to forge a good blade, one strong enough to withstand the blows, sharp enough to cut down the enemy. You give up, boy, or strike things straight on. Your brain isn't nimble; you can't think of clever ways or unorthodox strategies. I tell you, you should not have come back until you'd made absolutely sure that that thesis would pass." Jeering, he looked me straight in the eyes. "Tell me, did you really do everything you could have done? Tell me what you did?"As always when he surprise attacked, my throat choked on words that I couldn't articulate even in my mind. I didn't know how to show him the betrayal, how to make him understand or stop. Overcoming dumbness, I clumsily challenged, "Do you, do you, do you deserve to know what I did or didn't do?!" "Ah," he said with an air of triumph. "Is that it?" Cocking his head backwards, he laughed silently into the air.  "I've never heard that one before. You can't give me an answer, can you? Just like when you were a boy. Useless then, and useless now." He poked me in the chest again and again, as though trying to provoke a fight, waiting for me to strike a blow.  "I'll tell you what you did," he said, now waging his finger in my face. "Nothing! You did nothing!"My blood rose, and my fist clinched, the nails digging into the heart of my palm. "You," I hissed, "you--"With another snort, he raised a hand to cut me off. "Don't argue with me, boy! Don't make me lose my temper! Or have you forgotten? Your mother needs us!" As he turned and walked away, I struggled to subdue my voice, not wanting her to overhear. "Wait!  I plaintively commanded. Stop!"He entered Mother's room, and she greeted him with a question: "Did you have a good lunch?""Oh, wonderful," he answered soothingly. "Here they have full meals for a dollar fifty and coffee for ten cents!"I smoldered by the doorway, livid with anger, hating myself for having risen to the bait, which never seemed to fail. And his ultimate tactic of not rising to mine ran me through for the thousandth time.As he described the various entrees in detail and their respective prices, Mother listened in rapt attention as though she were hearing about a great adventure.Two Skies     vspeaking throughller sat in the cushioned chairining played on her robe of flamesuch .

7#$7UK6DWDWDWDWDWDetDDDDD"EEExDF F3J_*J?DWJ_FIJ_J_K,J_J_J_J_J_J_Chapter 3: HitchhikingFather, ensconced again in the cushioned chair, cried out in his sleep. What a familiar sound, one I had known since childhood."Your father's having one of his nightmares again," said Mother, and she put a hand on his shoulder. As he cried out a second time, she nudged him gently. "Cheng-xu," she whispered into his ear, "Cheng-xu." Soon his dream broke, and he mumbled unintelligible words as his eyes opened a sliver."He still has them two or three times a week?" I asked. "Yes.""Can you understand anything he says? Or does he still just mainly moan and groan?"Mother giggled and blinked, covering her mouth coquetishly as might a young girl. "He's a bit better spoken when he's conscious, but I'm afraid it's actually gotten worse since you left. He'll go on screaming for a long, long time if I don't wake him.... If you want to find out who he's talking to and why, you'll have to ask him?"I rubbed my chin at the notion.Father started coughing as he continued to crawl his way towards full consciousness. A noise from behind prompted me to turn around. There at the door stood Dr. Wong, the moon-faced medical resident. "Excuse me," he said with a smile as he entered the room. "Everything okay?""How ... how long have you been there?" I replied in English."A few minutes.""A few minutes?"He nodded. "And you understood what we said?"His smile broadened.Father's eyes were wide open now, but they didn't appear to be focused on anything in particular.Mother looked to the young resident. "You speak Chinese?" she asked in English."A little," he answered in heavily-accented Mandarin and bent down to pick up the clip board hanging from a hook at the foot of her bed. As he flipped through Mother's charts, he added in heavily-accented English, "I actually didn't learn Mandarin until I came to this country. Some friends of mine, other Malaysian Chinese, were trying to learn it. I picked it up from them." With great effort, Father lifted himself up out of his chair and started waddling about the room. The troglodyte roared a yawn, and when he was quite finished, he cleared his throat and said, "Can Dr. Belamy be trusted?"Though the question could only have been directed at Dr. Wong, the young resident responded with a look of confusion.  Perhaps it was that Father had spoken Mandarin, which had previously been used exclusively with Mother and I. "Oh yes," he finally said in Chinese, "Dr. Belamy is one of the best in his field in the world."Father, whose eyes had suddenly assumed a sharp, alert look now turned to face the doctor. "But," he pursued, switching to English, "can he be trusted?""Yes," said Dr. Wong, somewhat uneasily following his interrogator back into the language of his own preference. "Of course."  "And how about that Cuban doctor?"Dr. Wong returned the clip board to its hook. "Dr. Bravo?""Yes." said Father. "Can he be trusted?"Dr. Wong chuckled. "Of course.""Are you suuure?" "I ... I think so."The old man resoundingly clapped his hands together once. "Good then," he concluded in Mandarin. "If you trust them, then we trust them." Mother pointed at her abdomen. She asked still in English, "How much longer must I wait? Better now.""Yes," agreed Dr. Wong, " the incision's closed. But we've got to make sure that the internal system has fully recuperated. We've got to give it time.""Yes," said Father. "No rush."Dr. Wong smiled. "Dr. Belamy's orders. Personally, I think a few more days would do the trick, but he likes to take things nice and slow. At least another week." The young resident shrugged his shoulders. "He's the boss.""Yes, yes, yes," approved Father. "No hurry. No hurry."Mother made a face at the prospect of another seven days, but the combined efforts of three men in a mixture of English and Mandarin finally convinced her of caution's advantage.Very early on the ninth day, I left Bitterfield to check on our house.  As I drove along the banks of the wide Susquehanna, flanked on either side by long ridges as yet covered by winter's skeletal woods, my mind slipped back to a summer's day. I conjured towering trees with leafy boughs. I could almost smell the strong, sweet scent of dense vegetation in a south Pacific breeze.  The drive dragged on, but I roved again along a New Zealand beach, the wine-glass shaped bay before me speckled by a score of tiny, moonlight-frosted islands, its placid waters reflecting the luminescent clouds that sailed the night sky. By 9 AM, I was over a hundred miles from Bitterfield. Not having eaten breakfast, hunger kept me alert, so I didn't dare stop for food. The gas tank, however, was another matter. When the fuel needle fell to "empty", I took an exit and found a service station. Parking by a pump, I quickly refilled my tank. After paying the attendant in the station, I came out again to find a young man standing by the guardrail fifty yards or so down the road.He might have been in the adjacent convenience store when I'd pulled in. He might have sized me up while I pumped gas and then, during my absence, hastily positioned himself. It was a technique that I myself had used on a few occasions.  I got back into my car and slowly pulled out from between the pumps. As I passed him and he looked beyond my car towards the river, I saw the look of disappointment in his face.  Another hundred feet down the road, I braked to a stop. In the rear view mirror I watched him watching me, so I unlocked the passenger-side door and pushed it open. His face lit up with a smile.As the hitchhiker settled himself into the front passenger's seat of my car, we introduced ourselves. He was a student at our university on his way back after spring break. The exchange went no further, and I almost immediately forgot the name. Be that as it may, I felt a terrific urge to examine my guest and kept myself from doing so only with tremendous effort.  The hitchhiker found the lever at the base of his seat and reclined the back rest as far as it would go.  After a few minutes, I quickly looked over at him and then back again at the road.His eyes were shut.I looked once more.He had reddish brown hair, mostly covered by a bandanna tied babushka-style over his head. He had a prominent nose, which called to mind a cockatoo's beak. These were the salient features of his appearance. Curiosity satisfied, I turned back to the road, and my thoughts soon carried me away again across the southern oceans. I saw a small catamaran launching out into the waters of the wine-glass bay. I saw a tall Swedish man and myself wading into the low surf to climb aboard our vessel. I saw the tappered prows of the catamaran's twin hulls slicing through the waves. I felt the smooth, slightly undulating motion of the boat and the cool brush of the wind across my face. But in the next instant, this reverie was very rudely interrupted by a pickup truck that pulled out in front of us; I swerved sharply to avoid collision.  "Whoa!" said the young hitchhiker. He pulled his seat lever and jackknifed to a sitting position again.  Grinning from ear to ear, he continued, "I might have been sound asleep and dreaming I was getting killed. But I was wide awake and saw the whole thing. Man, it's lucky you were paying attention!""I ... I ... I'm sorry," I muttered. "Where did he come from? Was there a side road back there or something? I didn't see him at all!""Oh," said my passenger with a nod, his jagged smile quickly fading."Are you okay?" "Yeah," he said. "Sure."He stared straight ahead at the road. What seemed an interminable interval passed in silence.I felt compelled to finally confess, "I was thinking about New Zealand." "Oh yeah?" he said still not looking at me. "New Zealand, huh? You been there?""Yeah." He started nibbling at a fingernail. "When?""Just a little over a month ago."He spit out a bit of fingernail. "No kidding? What's it like?"A wave of dizziness swept over me, but in a moment it had passed. We were traveling at over seventy miles an hour. Had we hit, we wouldn't have had to worry about hospitals or wheelchairs for the rest of our days. It would have been over. I said, "They've got these parrots in New Zealand,.""Parrots? As in 'Polly want a cracker'?""Yeah. Except these guys have serious beaks."The young man nodded and peered out the window at the cut-away wall of a mountain. The rock strata were impressively thick. A few crevices revealed crystalline veins."These parrots ... their feathers are this ...  emerald green ."The young man turned away from the rock face and bowed his head, focusing aimlessly at the space between his knees. "But when they lift their wings," I pushed on, "you see these big patches of bright red. Christmas red." Briefly turning to the hitchhiker, I could just make out a faint smile. "They're called 'keas'. As big as hawks, with long, sharp, curved beaks. Saber-toothed parrots."My companion conceded a chuckle. "No kidding," he said turning to me. "Saber-toothed parrots. Man, wish I could see that." "New Zealand is sooo new," I said, "that its beaches are covered not by sand but by gravel.""Gravel?""It like the country rose up out of the ocean just yesterday, geologically speaking."  Nodding slowly, emphatically, I looked to my companion and frowned in amazement. "The surf simply hasn't had time yet to ground up the rock.""That's wild!"We rounded a curve, traveling with the broad, grey Susquehanna River beneath a leaden sky. A plank of wood floated down current, and great boulders showed above the shallow waters."In the southern tip of the South Island," I said, "there are fjords a mile deep. When you go out in skiffs, porpoises swim out to play with you. And the beech tree rainforests are this milky green. The thickest growth I've ever seen anywhere. The ferns are taller than men.. I mean, there you are this tiny little mouse hiding among the ferns, and you look up and voom! Glaciated mountains practically reaching straight to the clouds!" "Maaan," said my companion, "wish I could see that.""You could," I coaxed.He shrugged his shoulders and responded, "School.""So quit," I said flippantly.He chuckled again and added, "Money.""Join the merchant marines!""What?!""Think of it," I urged, taking both hands off the steering wheel for a split second. "You'd be with other young men! All of you seeing the world for the first time!"My friend's enthusiasm suddenly dampened. He bit his lower lip and looked down at the dash. "So what am I learning at school?" he said. "Right?""Not much?" I suggested.He knocked himself on the side of the head with the flat of his palm. "Am I afraid to quit?""No!" I cried with conviction."All I want," he said raising both hands into the air, "is to finish as soon as possible and get started. Find a job. Make some dough.""Ah, come on." I shook my head. "Come on, come on, come on!"His eyes widened. "No," he countered, "it's not that. You see, I want to fly!""Fly?""I want a plane, and that takes money. I know that means I'm making school and career means to an end, and maybe that's not how it's supposed to work--""Wait a minute," I said with a chuckle, trying to slow him down by batting the air. "How do you knooow you want to fly?""My uncle flew," he said simply.  "He had a plane." The boy shrugged his shoulders. "I've been up in the air since I was a kid.""One of these helium-filled babies? Had to keep you tied to a laundry line or else you'd float away."He started laughing. "Bye-bye baby. That's about the size of it, man. Right now while I'm in school I sky dive.""You jump out of planes?""Fall out of them," he corrected me. "Just lean back and fall."The conversation began to stall. The river to one side and mountain to the other slipped by to the loud but unheard drone of wind and tire traction. "In fact that's where I've just come from. Sky diving tournament.""Not Florida?""Nooo." He chuckled and shook his head. "Huh uh. That's where all my friends went. Daytona Beach, Fort Lauderdale. But not me, man. I belong to the sky."He stared straight ahead at the road, a wide, self-assured gin on his face. "You just lean back and you're free. Bet you'd love it. Why not give it try?""Not my style," I quietly replied. "Free fall takes guts." "No it doesn't," insisted my companion. "It takes belief." He began to explain about confidence in one's equipment and mastery of technique, about proper training and slow, calm focusing before the jump. "It takes preparation!" What if his chute failed to open one of these low-risk times? I wanted to know. Well, he'd be splattered he supposed. But if he were, it'd be worth it.  Why?... Why not? By this juncture I was nodding to his remarks and prodding him on with questions out of mere politeness. We were passing farms--brown fields decorated by the stubble of last year's corn. I craned my neck forward to look out the windshield and up at the sheet of solid white.  My father sat asleep in his chair next to my mother as she stood waiting for the scalpel to descend once more. She stood there before the window, before the sight of the infinite clouds, using the ledge of the window as a working platform to produce more paper pills, only tinier than the one's she'd made for mine and this time with her own fates written in minscule characters penned within their folds. What were those characters obscured to view? "Success" and "failure"? Or, possibly, "life" and "death"? How I wished, how I wished, how I wished I could lean back and fall into the sky. Buried in the sky. "What time is it?" asked the hitchhiker.I looked at the dashboard clock and replied, "Almost ten." "Great," he said with a nod. "We should be there by lunch."Two Skies     v,hospital ward hospital room viewcloud-covered sky for the impending surgeybefore the transparent glass, i"Full recovery" and "not"? .Sun Rolan asked, "Howwy7:LN^k$$%%&&''''(6(:(()g)k+"+$,,,Q,T-Z-`--..00117:7A7O7P7T7U7Z7[7\7j7k7y7z7~77777777777@P@H]#5GTxB|!]]]}\jjj$#p@P $#p@P $#p@P $#p@P $#p@P $#p@P )\IJK|jiO5$&p@P $&p@P $&p@P $&p@P $&p@P $#p@P $#p@P $#p@P T)>;W  C!4!j!!"k"##$6$%%&&&eee$&p@P $&p@P $&p@P $&p@P $&p@P $&p@P !&((()) )G)e)o***+ +@+,,W,_,-s-.\../*/0001K12n33666797:~s$&p@P $&p@P $&p@P $&p@P $&p@P &7:7Q7R7S7T7U7\7k7z7777$,$Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C#8p@$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@6@7U5|"#)/6@P@P/@P@P7\&7:7 !U/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH@Rd(Xd=/BH-: HP DeskJetENew YorkGenevaMonacoPalatinoTimesHelveticaCourierSymbolMishawakaMishawaka BoldUTrebuchet MSArialCharcoalCapitalsSandCourier NewTechnoMonotype SortsTimes New RomanWingdingsHoefler TextHoefler Text OrnamentsImpactSkiaTextileGadgetApple ChanceryMT ExtraComic Sans MS/BrushScrDKBalloonDExtBoliCooperBlaDDomCasualDRegParkAveDAndale Mono#VerdanaBernhardFasDURWImperialTRegEurostileTBlaExtURWBodoniTReg MicrogrammaDMedExt CNevisonCasD ENicolasCocTReg OkayD OldEnglishD!PlaybillD!SpringfieldD"VAGRundschriftD"WindsorDReg$*BrodyJoiD$6HogarthScrJoiD$BVladimirScrJoiD%Missy BT%Liorah BT%Ryan BT%Hank BT%Melanie BT/-Arial Black/Georgia6ArabBruD7Webdings7BlacklightD9ChesterfieldAntD9GilliesAntDBol:DLegerD:eColumnaSolSCD:GoudySwaTLigIta:CoronetI?Chicago5h5h5hU=( <++223333334444444525K5M5h666667,737k4747z47~45j7Z5o75767677:7S7T,Desktop PublishingDesktop Publishing

7#$&^i0l,\,\HHHHJHXHXHXHdHHHI xHXI IM*N'HMIMM^81MMMMMMChapter 4: The Strange BoyThe blue '78 Honda Accord was the second car our family had ever owned. The first was a bright yellow Datsun Honeybee my sister had gotten a year before her exodus to California. Throughout my childhood and youth we had taken the bus whenever distances were too far to walk. For parties, weddings, etc. the family resorted to cabs.  Which is why I still associate taxi rides with suits that hug, shoes that bite and ties that choke, with brocade silk dresses that shine and embroidered silk jackets that smell of lilac. Upon arrival at our destination, Mother would pay the fare, invariably adding a little bit extra.  "This is for your cigarette," she would say. Half the cabbies who ever ferried us undoubtedly never understood a word.I chuckled as I tucked into a generous slice of plain pizza set before me on an oil-soaked paper plate. A sip of icy Coke cut the grease, and I muttered to myself, "How did she know how much a cigarette cost?" I was home again, seated on a swivel stool at the counter of Brothers'. The owners, known affectionately to me and my grade school buddies as Romulus and Remus, no longer whirled disks of pizza dough on the tips of their fingers, above their heads; they had long since supplanted themselves behind the counter with fresh immigrantsGuatemalans and El Salvadorianswho might not have been up to aerial acrobatics and, instead, pressed the dough flat onto baking trays. This day's pizza master was a young man with a mousy mustache and fine olive skin.My waitress, who stood before me scribbling out the bill, had black hair and blue eyes. She looked to be in her late thirties or early forties, but the wrinkles around those striking eyes might have been signs of life and not age. "Anything else?" she asked, setting the bill down in front of me. I shook my head. "No thanks."Turning away without a word, she walked to a table where two other waitresses sat with newspapers spread out before them. My waitress sat down too and picked up a paper with big red-letter headlines in Spanish. When I'd finished my meal, I left two dollars on the table and took the bill to the counter register. Coming out of Brothers', I looked up at the noon sky to see wispy cloud streaks, which meant the possibility of a storm a couple of days down the pike. As I walked along the street, I reviewed the remaining things to do before returning to Bitterfield: phone calls to my sister and my best friend Chris, who had recently moved to Pasadena as a postdoctoral fellow at Cal Tech. An oil level check of my car engine, and a hydraulic fluid check of the brake cylinders.  The Honda had to get me back to hospital without a hitch; tomorrow was the eve of Mother's second operation.The doctors had assured us that they had treated similar patients many times in the past and that removing the cancer grapes would be routine.  With successful surgery and appropriate chemotherapy, Mother might expect three to five more years. We should be grateful. In a funk, I went into the corner convenience store to buy a magazine. Just as I came out, two boys raced towards me on bicycles. They sped past, and the second boy spat, his bubble gum spittle hitting me square on the lips.  Wrenching his head he cried, "Gong dong wong!" He had long blond hair and a black heavy metal T-shirt. In the next instant, he and his friend disappeared around the corner. The following morning the sky was another low, grey ceiling. Traffic on the interstate was sparse. Mist filled the hollows to create cloud lakes, some with tiny lens-shaped islands exposed above their ragged white waves. I drove in and out of fog.  A portable cassette recorder rode the passenger's seat beside me.  Because the feel of spit on my mouth was still fresh, I thought back to Utica, New York, where I had been born and spent the first five years of my life. By the early sixties, Utica was already a depressed place, a city trying desperately to hold onto industries beyond hope of resuscitation. When Mother took my sister and I downtown, the big glass display windows of deserted department stores offered nothing more than dark, semi-transparent reflections.We lived on Eagle Street, where there were few trees and many, closely-spaced wooden houses. In a house behind our backyard was a family with seven kids; in the house next door was one with six.  My sister had a friend, the oldest girl of the backyard brood, but I was too little to qualify as anybody's pal with the possible exception of three-year-old Ben of the side clutch, who was given to peels of shrill laughter and prodigious quantities of drool. Consequently, I spent most of my time alone, with chin and hands propped on the window sill, gazing out at the world. By spying on the ragamuffin beggars who sifted through our garbage, I derived a meager sense of camaraderie.One day as I was sat on the porch idling away the hour before dinner, a boy walking down the sidewalk on the other side of the street suddenly crossed the road and came straight at me.  The older neighborhood boys had only ever hurled taunts; I should have been alarmed. But I remember the openness of his face."Hi," he said. "What are you doing?""Nothing," I answered. He was at least a head taller."You want to play?" .Of course I wanted to play, but I responded with a shrug.  When he motioned for me to follow, however, I did so without hesitation.  We passed by every house on my block, and then we crossed the road. Though this was the first time I had ever crossed the street with anybody other than my parents, I didn't feel particularly uneasy. As we walked, I noted that my guide had brown, close-cropped hair. He wore jeans, a striped tee-shirt and black canvas sneakers.  Since his strides out-distanced mine, I had to skip to keep up. Before I really knew it, we were in a strange neighborhood, one in which the houses were bigger but weather-beaten, their paint cracked and peeling.  "What's your name?" he asked."David," I answered."I'm Leonardo."I nodded even though he wasn't watching."Where do you go to school?" asked Leonardo."I don't go to school."He looked at me. "Do you go to a nursery school?""No," I said. "But I start kindergarten next year."Stopping abruptly in his tracks, he extended a hand, which I took hold of. He whipped my arm up and down several times and said, "I go to Miller School. Second grade." Releasing my hand, he turned and marched on. I felt flushed with pride that such a boy took me as peer. Skipping again to catch up, I mentioned that my sister Jennifer was in the second grade at Miller School too! Leonardo didn't know her.After another block, he stopped again. Before us loomed a three-story house with gray wooden planks that had only flecks of paint left. A man in a soiled white tee-shirt stood on the very top-most rung of a fully-extended double-section wooden ladder, scraping away at a window frame. I wondered whether this was Leonardo's father, whether the window belonged to his bedroom. But of course, I didn't dare ask. "Hey!" shouted Leonardo up to the man, whose jeans and high-top leather work boots were spotted by oil stains. "Hey! Papa!"The man looked over his shoulder and down at the two of us.  He had medium-length hair and a gaunt face. Leonardo grinned triumphantly and waved up at him. Immediately, the man started clambering down the ladder with amazing speed.  My mind drew a blank as I anticipated that the meeting would occasion a few words on my part. Should I offer a hand, or would it be better to wait for him to offer his? I was so ill-prepared.Upon touching ground, the man unbuckled his belt and pull it free from his jeans. Next, he grabbed Leonardo by the shoulder and started whipping him across the back.  After a half dozen strokes, he took hold of his son's collar and jerked the silent boy towards the front door. They entered the house; the door slammed shut.Left alone on the sidewalk, I waited to see what would happen next. Perhaps I half-expected the man and Leonardo to come out again, greet me and invite me in for a snack.  Long minutes passed, but nothing happened. As the day began to settle into twilight, I turned and slowly started on my way. The streets were dark and hazy, but I didn't have any trouble getting home again. There, I found my mother in the kitchen. As was often the case approaching dinnertime, she seemed cross. "Not now," she said to me as she contended with a pan on the stove, the oil hissing and sputtering. So I stood there by the doorway without making a sound. Despite the barrage of chores, she must have sensed that something was amiss because she eventually turned down the burner and got me a glass of water, which I drank greedily. Then she picked me up in her tired arms and took me to the sturdy maple rocking chair in the living room. As she held me and we rocked, she asked me what was the matter. I lay my head on her shoulder and shook my head, still trying to come to grips with an incident that left me totally perplexed. With each rock my strange encounter receded further and further. With each stroke of my mother's hand through my hair, the strokes of the father's belt on his son's body seemed to soften until I almost questioned that they hurt at all.

7#$JdnIRWRWZZZZZZZZZZZ[ZxZ[ [`!*`KZ`!\`!`!dB,`!`!`!`!`!`!Chapter 5: A Request for Details"Man-niang and Jin-cheng were distracted by hunger," said Father from the comfortable embrace of his now customary chair.Mother sat at the small desk beside the bed and busied herself with a letter.  From where I stood at my station by the window, I marveled at the strength and stamina she had regained. "Wait," I said to Father. "It's Mother's turn to tell a story."The old man brought his yarn to an abrupt halt and smiled a thin, perhaps injured smile."I think it might be nice to hear a few more tales from her childhood," I explained, sticking my hands into my pants pockets. Father chuckled and nodded. "Yes," he said. "That's right." He looked to Mother and nodded again. "Your son has made an official request."Mother shrugged her shoulders. "What's there to tell?" She tapped her pen lightly on the desk. "We spent a lot of time running through the fields and woods and making mischief."I said, "Give us some examples of this 'mischief'."Mother looked quixotically to Father."Yes," came the old man, knotting his fingers together. "Tell us about your adventures. Like those of Tom Sawyer."She frowned at her husband. "That's quite enough.""Well then," I said buttressing a leg against the wall and leaning forward in my stance, "what about later years? I don't know anything about your youth. For instance, what were your school days like?""I and my brothers and sisters didn't go to school.""Uh huh?" I encouraged."We had private tutors.""That was for the rich," explained Father. "Poor people like us couldn't afford them."This elicited a second, much more severe frown from Mother. "Your Man-niang hired tutors for her boys, didn't she?""Well ... yes," admitted Father."So she was rich too!" concluded Mother.Smiling self-consciously, Father said, "I suppose, relatively so." He started wringing his hands. "It's true we had our notable officials and military men.... But nobody in our family quite reached the zenith of your father. No, not he."I could see exactly what was coming, so I scowled at the old man and said, "Faaather.""Alright, alright," he returned with a cackling laugh. "Not another word. Not another word."Now in a brown mood, Mother hunched over the letter she was writing."Mother?" I said.She made no reply."Maybe later you could tell me more?" I said hopefully. "I could even set up the cassette recorder."She knit her brows. "What a bother.""No," I said. "Not a bother at all. It would be good to get your stories down on tape. That way I could listen to them a second time. Jennifer could listen to them too. At least someday."She looked up at me, her face relaxing slightly. "Your sister wouldn't be interested." "She might be.""And besides," said Mother giving me a little smile, "there's still plenty of time. Really there is. I'll tell her my stories in person someday when she is interested. No need for tape recorders. And, of course, I'll tell you too. Promise.""I know," I said, "I know," sighing and resigning myself to frustration. I wanted so badly to know about her life. To learn as much as possible. To commit every detail to memory.Father pulled a worn and ragged palm-size spiral notebook out of his trouser pocket and started flipping through the pages.Studying my face, Mother shook her head and frowned in mock exasperation. "Let me think now," she began with a sigh of her own. "One day in a city gardens, your Auntie Wong and I were caught in a Japanese air raid. Did you know that?""Yes," I said.Laying down her pen she added, "Both my legs were broken and somewhat badly burned.""I knew that too," I said. "Your father took you to sacred Mount Emei. Mountain people carried you in a sedan chair up the pilgrims' path. They ran with you upon their shoulders so that by evening you rested in a temple half-way up the summit, so close to the clouds that you could practically tickle their feathery bellies. Monks wrapped your legs in medicinal grasses and leaves and cared for you until they healed."Father, who had been scribbling something, lowered his pencil stub and raised his head. He looked to be listening intently."That's why I quit medical school," said Mother sitting back in her chair and clasping her hands over her belly. "I could no longer take the strain.""Hence," I concluded, "you became a teacher,"Mother smiled. "I've discovered that you know quite a bit about me .""Of course not," I said defensively. "Like I don't know everything that happened after you went to Taiwan to teach at that girl's academy. I mean, I know the broad outline, but--""Can you remember," queried Father, his eyes trained upon Mother and his pencil stub poised again over the pocket notebook, "the price I quoted you earlier for the chicken sandwich I had at the cafetaria? I want a record for posterity.""Chicken sandwich?" I said. "Posterity?"He smirked. "So that someday when prices are sky high, Guang Guang and Ping Ping will appreciate what they had when they were young.""That's enough," said Mother, wincing as though in pain."Are you alright?" I asked."Yes," she answered. "It's nothing. I probably just pulled something in my side. From all this lieing down and sitting around."The old man laid the pencil stub and notebook on the lamp stand next to his chair. "It's time to rest!" he declared."No, wait," I said. "What happened next?"She answered with another frown. "Alright, alright," said Father raising his hands into the air and waving off my questions. "That's quite enough now. Give your poor mother a rest, why don't you?" Resuscitating her smile, Mother said,  "Really. There's not that much to tell.""Yes, there is," I insisted. "I don't know any of the 'whys' of your life.""Your father's a far better story teller than I, and he's got plenty of energy.""Let your mother rest now!" cried Father. "Let her rest! You'll tire her out! Think about somebody else for a change!""I'm not not letting her rest!"Mother was deferring to him again: their pattern in so many things. The old man relished the spotlight, craved attention. I felt like boycotting his story; I wanted to turn my back on him and walk out the door.... But could I have done so without hurting Mother too?"Great Great Grandmother," said Father, "did not flinch in the face of her children's big, big trouble. She instructed Jin-cheng to stop snivelling and gather up their wedding presents. Then she sent him down to the town's most generous pawn shop to place the gifts into hock." Looking at me significantly, Father smiled and nodded. I looked past the old man at the quarter moon through the window. Mother was back at her desk, writing another note to someone."The pawn broker gave Jin-cheng seven silver coins.  One of these was spent on rice, oil and vegetables for the week while the remainder were invested in a spinning wheel, a loom and a large sack of cotton. In the newlyweds' small flat, Great Great Grandmother set up a mill and taught her daughter how to spin thread and weave it into cloth. "The first week's work was difficult, and poor Jin-cheng had nothing to do but to watch his wife.  He must have wondered whether they would actually be able to make money, fretted that six irreplaceable pieces of silver were being squandered. By the week's end, Man-niang had produced a slim bolt of rough cotton cloth, which Jin-cheng took to a cloth merchant."To his surprise, the bolt sold for two silver pieces. There would be food for the week and enough raw cotton to produce a slightly fatter bolt than the first! Man- niang's skill at weaving steadily improved, and by the end of their first year of marriage, she was producing three regular-sized, high-quality bolts in six days with a gross weekly profit of ten silver coins!"Now," said Father, his metronome knees setting a smart tempo, "Jin-cheng's trips to the cloth merchant became such routine that their sense of urgency completely faded.  He was, after all, a sixteen year old boy. One day on his trip home from the cloth merchant's, he took a different, longer route than usual, one that brought him past the training oval of the local garrison."On that particular afternoon, the commander's personal guard were practicing archery. To Jin-cheng this was a real spectacle, so he stopped to enjoy himself, sitting down beneath a tree and resting his bundle on the ground. Eventually the soldiers finished and retired from the field, and Jin-cheng resumed his homeward journey. Some distance down the road, however, he felt for the purse tied to his belt and was horrified to find it missing! He rushed back to the training oval, but as you might expect, he came away absolutely nothing."As Great Great Grandmother often visited the young couple on market days, she happened to come by this particular afternoon. And as on her very first visit after the wedding, she found her children lying together--this time on their bed--balling their eyes out."Smiling smugly, Father paused to cast another glance in my direction. "Although they had actually managed to squirrel away some savings, success had lulled them into a false sense of security, now completely shattered by a serious but less than devastating blow. It didn't take Great Great Grandmother long to coax from Jin-cheng a complete account of the fiasco. She could have knocked him senseless for such stupidity." "But for her bound feet," I noted. "Youch."Father's knees stopped rocking and he grunted, "Hm! Do you want to hear this story, or do you want to make smart remarks?!""Alright, alright," I said. "Keep going.""That's the trouble with this boy," he complained to Mother. "Doesn't take anything seriously." Switching to English he concluded, "Guang Guang will come to ruin someday. You watch!  You watch!""Alright already," I said.Mother looked up from her writing. "Guang Guang," she urged, "Your father's tired." Turning to her husband, she instructed, "You can finish telling your story tomorrow." Father  sat up straight in his chair. "But I'm not tired," he said with a snort. "Not tired at all. This boy had just better listen carefully and learn what he can while there's still time."Wincing, I held my peace, and Mother returned to writing. "This time," resumed the old man in English, "there was nothing Great Great Grandmother could tell her children. She had to take matters into her own hands." The troglodyte's knees slowly started swinging again. "She went home and had two of her daugthers' husbands carry her to the house of the commander, who was surnamed Yang. His second cucumber's mother happened to be a close friend of Great Great Grandmother's, and--""That's 'concubine'," I said. "Not 'cucumber'. Stick to Chinese.""And," said Father in Chinese, "it was through this woman that an indirect appeal was made to the second concubine, who, in turn, was so deeply moved that she readily pledged her help."Now, Commander Yang was an opium addict, and his second concubine smoked with him every day after the noon meal. On the afternoon following Great Great Grandmother's visit, she lay with her husband on their wide bed. The commander was in fine spirits and offered her first draw on the pipe, and graciously she accepted. As she finished her turn and passed the pipe back to him, she said, 'It's unfortunate that discipline among your men has slackened to the point that one would actually rob a hapless pair of weavers.'"Naturally, the commander's curiosity was piqued. He pressed the woman for an explanation.  After only a few evasive maneuvers, she relayed the entire story of the archery practice, the mesmerized boy and the lost purse. The commander immediately resolved to right the wrong. The very next morning, he summoned each member of the archery squad to his study for a private interview. Through careful questioning, he whittled suspicion down to a single sergeant who had been seen in the vicinity of Jin-cheng's shade tree shortly after target practice."'I know you took the silver!' barked Commander Yang. 'You were the only one who went near where that boy sat. It had to be you!'"A man's wits are his fortress. So long as he doesn't lose his nerve and open the gates, he cannot easily be taken.  The commander got absolutely nowhere with the sergeant, and in the end had to let him go with a severe reprimand.  Afterall, had anybody actually seen the sergeant pick the pouch off the ground? Who's to say that some civilian passing by hadn't found the money and made off with it?"The second concubine was a persistent woman. An afternoon did not pass that she didn't bring up the issue of the stolen purse. Unable to crack the mystery, the good commander sent for Jin-cheng and offered him a job as his personal valet."Father glanced at me and said, "Needless to say, Jin-cheng knew enough not to say no." He turned away again. "And that's how your great grandfather came to be a soldier; how he and Man-niang escaped destitution a second time, and most importantly, how this branch of the family managed to survive."The old man became quiet, possibly considering his own son's imminent downfall. Would this young man have the practicality and presence of mind to say "yes" at the critical moment, which would presumably come in a dean's office of some small California college. Mother finally laid her pen down and said, "Is the story over yet?""Haven't you been listening?" I asked.She frowned and shrugged her shoulders. Father yawned. Soon a young nurse appeared at the door. Her smile indicated that family visiting hours were over. Some years after Jin-cheng joined the army, the bandits in the mountains to the southwest of Anshun city began to raid its nearby villages.  Robbing and killing and making off into the hills with young women and boys. When there was a great public outcry, Commander Yang organized an expedition and personally led it into the hills.The mountains of Guizhou are sinks. So thick are the forests that the weak light of dusk seems to fall into them and disappear. All sound is swallowed up. The expedition marched three days into this wilderness.Very early one morning, as the commander slept in his tent and the soldiers on watch looked out into a forest still shrouded by the cold shadows of mountains, bandit scouts crept silently through the mist towards the perimeter of the camp.  When they were quite near to the sentries, they let fly their steel spikes, which pierced each target's skull.The entire host of bandits rose from the ground and crept towards the camp.  The growing rustle in the bush alerted a cook, who saw the fallen body of one of the sentries and gave a great cry. A bandit scout lunged at the cook from behind and jammed a knife into the side of his neck, pushing outwards with the blade to cut the windpipe. The mist began to dance as the bandits rushed in.On the previous afternoon, Commander Yang had insisted that his exhausted men dig a trench around their camp and plant it with sharpened spikes. The single unhindered path into camp bottle-necked the bandits' charge, enabling most of the soldiers to escape their tents before being caught inside.As it soon proved, Commander Yang had been doubly shrewd in having brought a large contingent. As many men as the bandits cut down in the initial assault, enough survivors soon rallied to fight them off. The only poor decision on the commander's part was venturing deep into the mountains in the first place. For when the perimeter was once again secured and the bandits melted back into the forest mist, Commander Yang lay dead on the ground with an arrow through his neck.  The color of its fins indicated that it belonged to one of his own men. As none of the survivors claimed possession, it now belonged solely to the unlucky officer.They tied his body to the back of a mule and marched out of the mountains. The bloodied party was met outside of Anshun's western gate by the rest of the city garrison. Jin-cheng, now a sergeant, prepared the body for cremation, and the next day, it was burned and the ashes sealed in a bronze urn. Holding this urn in front of him, Commander Yang's son led his four mothers and entire household entourage on foot through the western gate as they began a trek to the province called "South of Clouds."Since Anshun was the second greatest opium hub in all of southwestern China, it warranted special attention. The new commander was the lieutenant governor of the province himself. This was, of course, purely a temporary arrangement until a successor could be found. By this juncture, Man-niang and Jin-cheng had a house with several rooms. They had a nine year old daughter and three young sons. The daughter helped Man-niang spin and weave. The boys studied classics, for which Man-niang engaged a tutor.Man-niang converted the front room of their house into an apothecary for the sale of medicinal herbs, which she didn't pick in the forest herself because of her bound feet. Whenever she walked more than a few dozen steps, her feet seared with pain. Instead, she purchased her herbs in bulk whenever they came available at the local markets and then hoarded them.  As she usually had what people wanted when they wanted it, she realized handsome profits.One day Man-niang learned from Jin-cheng that the lieutenant governor was in a stink over shoes. His feet were evidently so sensitive that nothing to suit them could be found in all of Anshun. With this in mind, the clever woman sheared off her hair, which had never before been cut and previously hung down to her waist.  Sandwiching soft, black hair between six layers of the finest cloth she had ever woven Man-niang fashioned a pair of soles, into which were put a hundred stitches with the strongest cord money could buy. When the soles were finished, she commissioned a master cobbler to attach supple, decorated leather uppers.Man-niang manipulated Jin-cheng into presenting the magnificient shoes to the lieutenant governor. When the great personage slipped them on, a smile of sublime pleasure came to his face.  In whimsical gratitude, he promoted Jin-cheng to first lieutenant in charge of mules.  Within the month, he was new garrison commander.  Did it concern the lieutenant governor that Jin-cheng might not be up to the job? If so, all the better. Should the unlikely fellow fall short, then chances were the governor would take the blame. If failure were catastrophic, then maybe even a tumble. Indeed, the wily, ambitious lieutenant governor might well have hoped for a second massacre.

The water would quench the thirst of awakening seedlings.Mother lay in bed in her robe of flame red. Father sat beside her in his chair."We've decided," he said, "that this time when I go back to China, your mother will come with me. We'll go as soon as she's fully recovered. All these years she's stayed away from China, partly to save money and partly because she didn't agree with the Communists. Her family suffered terribly at their hands." All these years Father had tormented Mother about her father, the "warlord". Had the verdict finally been reversed?"Also, Mother could never bring herself to leave you children, but now that both of you are grown up, she doesn't have to worry."For the first time in my memory, Father took Mother's hand in his.  Her smile was positively radiant. Yet there I stood smoldering like a lump of half-spent coal. "I've also always been carsick," said Mother scowling.Father sniffled and rubbed his eyes. "We'll find her brothers and sisters; we'll visit the graves of her parents and grandparents. Then I'll take her back to my home in the mountains. And from there we'll go ... anywhere she pleases. Everywhere  she pleases!""I've seen my share of sights," said Mother shrugging her shoulders nonchalantly. "I'll be happy just to be with the family.""But there's so much of China you haven't seen yet," said Father. "And the changes in Beijing and Shanghai! They'd amaze you!"Mother looked to me with a mischievous grin. "There are lots of places and things I've never seen before.""Alright, alright," said Father softly. "Whatever you want." "Very well," said Mother magnanimously. "We'll go to Beijing."Father patted her hand again and again, and Mother simply lay there smiling as though this were something he did every day. "From now on we're going to take things easy," declared the old man. "We're going to enjoy life.""Guang Guang," said Mother as she wiggled her hand free from Father's."Yes," I said.She gestured for me to come closer. Removing the gold band and amethyst ring from her finger, she held them out to me and said, "I am not going to die this time." "I know," I told her, "but I don't need these.""Your father gave me this violet crystal when we were engaged. He gave me this ring of purest gold when we were married. You hold onto them while I'm in surgery today. Keep them safe. For me as well as for your future wife." I nodded and accepted the rings. My heart still ached, but the bitterness was gone.The nurses came early to prepare Mother.  Father and I were made to leave the room.  When we were allowed back in, she was standing beside the bed dressed in a billowing white gown that was closed in the back by a series of tiny bows. The nurses told us that there might be a brief delay and then left us alone.Father tried to get Mother to lie down again, but she refused. Although she didn't need support, Father held her hand and braced her shoulder as she walked slowly back and forth across the floor.  This doting prompted Mother to make a funny face, as though she'd eaten a bad banana. When I mirrored this expression, she smiled and wrinkled her nose. "Have you called your sister yet?" she asked stopping in front of the window."Yes," I said. "I called her last night.""Is she going to work today?""Yes."Mother smiled and swerved, Father holding her close. "You convinced her it would be useless to sit around and wait?" she said."I convinced her we would call her at her office as soon as the operation was over.""Good," said Mother resuming her walk in a new direction."It's better if she goes to work," agreed Father.  "Or she might lose her job."I frowned. "She wouldn't lose her job for this."Mother paused by the closed door. Through its narrow window could be seen a nurse rushing past. "I'm going to leave Ping-yu my jade bracelet," she said, "and the Swiss watch your father gave me. Her husband will someday give her an engagement ring and gold band, so she won't have need of these things from me.  But the Swiss watch? She always used to like to play with it as a little girl. Do you remember?" "Sit down and rest," pleaded Father."No," said Mother, "I'm alright."The room was bright with fluorescent light.  The sun had all but abandoned the sky. The watery streaks on the window blurred a drab world, and I wondered where the birds had gone to.Two medical technicians knocked on the door but didn't wait for a reply before rolling in an elevated bed.  Once more, Father and I were made to wait outside.  After fifteen minutes, the technicians opened the door to let us in again. This time, Mother was supine upon the platform, a white linen sheet covering her up to the chest, her arms resting on top.Father quickly went to her and lay his hands upon hers.  One of the technicians mumbled something to him about official forms, and Father followed him out ."Guang," said Mother softly.I drew close. "Yes?""There's one more ring for you.""I don't need any more rings," I said.Mother smiled and shook her head. "When I left home for university my grandmother gave me her wedding ring. My grandmother probably lived at the same time that your father's grandmother Man-niang did. When China was still ruled by an emperor.""Why did your grandmother give you her wedding ring?" I asked, aching in my heart to stroke her hair but for some reason not daring to. "Your husband was bound to give you a ring when you married.""The ring was for luck," said Mother, "and courage."I nodded, casting down my gaze, ashamed of my weakness."When my grandmother was a young girl her mother fell ill. Fever consumed her, and the physicians said she was destined for an early grave. Her only hope, they said, was a medicine that derived its power from human flesh." Mother frowned and shrugged her shoulders.  "But where was human flesh to be gotten?""I don't know," I whispered."But a doe-eyed young girl knew," said Mother.  "One morning she sent a maid servant to the physicians with a silver bowl covered by a scarf of the lightest spring-and-summer silk.  Inside were seven ounces of human flesh. My grandmother had cut them from her own body." Mother stretched her hand toward my head, and I bent over so that she could stroke my hair."Her mother recovered, and when the Emperor learned of this deed, he commissioned a gold medallion for her inscribed with the words 'filial child'. He invited the young heroine to his palace for a month-long holiday. But as fine as the medallion was, the spirit of my grandmother--your great grandmother--chose to dwell not in it but in her wedding ring.  I know this because she gave me her ring when I left home, and wherever I have gone she has come with me in my dreams, to act as guide.  After my father died, he too came to me in my dreams.  They are my guardians, and now they will be yours." I stood hunched over her chest, keeping my weight off, almost hovering, as she continued to move her fingers through my hair. "But what if," I said, "they don't want to be my guardians?""They do," answered Mother."Have they said so?""They never talk to me about you," said Mother. "They never worry about you because I never worry about you. They are proud of you, and they feel my pride. Your great grandmother, your grandfather and I talk about your sister and father.  They help me protect them. They will help you protect them as well."She touched me on the shoulder, and I half raised myself up to look into her eyes, which were calm and fearless."They will guide you now," she said, "as you must guide your father.  Never forget that your first duty is to him. I depend on you."I wanted to say that I would do my best, that I would honor her wishes, but the words caught in my throat. Not because I was embarrassed or choked by sadness but because just then I realized that Mother loved Father more than anybody in the world. More even than me and my sister. In the next instant, Father appeared with the hospital technicians."Everything's been taken care of," he reported."Good," said Mother.As she raised her arms, Father took her right hand in his and I her left.  We walked beside her as they wheeled the platform to the operating room. Two Skies     Tyv the rain came down in sheets. With npprove ofwith a scowlMother said,  pleaseMother's her.,Mother resumed she d, so she won't have need of tho"Yes," I said to my mother.

7#$OjP+VWVW^^^^^^^^^^^_fx^_ _d-*dW^d-`d-d-jv,d-d-d-d-d-d-Chapter 7: The Waiting Room GenBesides Father and myself, five other people were planted in the cushioned sofas lining the walls of the waiting room. They looked to be one family--an elderly couple, two small children and a man in his prime.  The children--a boy and a girl--seemed remarkably well-behaved.  The elderly couple looked worried. The young man seemed lost in thought.My mother had married a man eighteen years her senior and had followed him half way around the globe to an alien land. I tried counting the pastel flowers on the wall to still my mind.When I had become too old for the rocking chair, my mother had attempted to learn how to play catch with me, but how far in this pursuit could a tiny, overworked woman in confining, ankle-length Chinese dresses go? In loving gratitude, I had swept and raked and mowed and painted since it was evident even to a small boy that household work had no end.Father sat with his head bowed and eyes trained to the floor. His hands were knotted together beneath his belly, his legs crossed at the ankles. I noticed that the tip of the beard was clamped between lips set into a tight, mirthless grin.Why had he spent so much time reading newspapers, watching television, drinking? I understood that he was tired from eight hours on the job, but there were no eight or ten or twelve hours a day for Mother. She cooked, cleaned and washed clothes. She carried every bag of groceries on foot over a mile's distance from the supermarket. On weekends, she took care of the lawn and garden and did household repairs, only asking Father for help when repairs were beyond her knowledge or strength. In the evenings even as she cooked or helped with homework, she endured his bitter tirades about his job, his American bosses, his spendthrift wife, who wasted precious financial resources on crayons and drawing paper. We children could do just as well with pencil stubs and the waste computer printout sheets he brought home from work. By throwing away money on indulgences today, she was not only squandering our college funds but spoiling us, ruining our professional prospects. We needed hardships to make us fit for the future. Our future, that was all she ever heard about. I wondered that the woman didn't retched at the mere allusion to her children's imminent brilliance, which she was apparently jeopardizing by constant subversive activity. The fevers and headaches, the nausea and vomiting, these were the physical manifestations of an exhausting, grinding present. Without ever landing a blow, Father brutalized Mother. Yet she forgave him. Oh, how big her heart; despite all the bitterness that it somehow accommodated there was still room for clemency. The many long years like a winter without spring, a war without truce. How was it possible for love to endure, to survive and prevail? Was that what she was teaching me now? The lesson of the general's daughter? I suddenly saw her on the operating table, motionless, her eyes shut. I heard her voiceless whisper: "Take care of him. Your duty.""Tell me what happened to Man-niang and Jin-cheng," I said curtly.Father sat frozen, a man of stone."Did Jin-cheng make a good commander?" I asked with a sigh. "Did Man-niang grow rich from her trade in medicinal herbs?... Come on.... What happened to them?""Nothing happened to them," answered Father indifferently, his voice barely a whisper."It isn't good to brood," I said, trying hard not to sound snide. "Tell me a story. It will make us both feel better."Still, Father said nothing. I was aware that there were glories in his past in China, and in America he had found but the narrow niche of a computer programmer and techno-sweatshop overseers who followed him to the bathroom to rap on the door if he stayed a second beyond his allotted minutes. Could I have borne it any better, the disappointment and humiliation?Just as I reconciled myself to his silence and sat back again to try to admire the wallpaper, the old man began, "Man-niang grew rich, and Jin-cheng built a fort deep in the mountains." "Why?" I asked, watching him from the corner of an eye. He shrugged his shoulders. "To have a base from which to deal with the brigands?"A faint smile came to his lips. "I can see that your mother's lessons were not entirely wasted." The smile disappeared. "Did you know that your mother was once a medical student?""Of course," I said."Did you know that one day when she and your Godmother Wong--""Jennifer's Godmother--""Were strolling in a public gardens--""Japanese bombing raid; I know already!""Both her legs were broken and burned." The guy was trying to divert attention to a time before his appearance in her life, but Mother's cancer derived from the more recent past!"And her legs never really healed," he lamented. "You remember how they were always scabby and bleeding? Aching and painful to the touch? Nevertheless, she carried the load for us. There wasn't anything she didn't do. Without her, what sort of life would we have had? What sort of life could I have had? My life was already over when we married; I had nothing to offer. I simply took. Took and took and took." The old man shut his eyes and started to knock his head with his fists."Ba," I said, suddenly conscious of the other people in the room.  "After Jennifer and I left home there was a lot less to take care of.... We were probably the main reason for her fatigue.""No," said Father, vehemently shaking his head. "That's not true.""And after you retired, you had more time and energy." He pressed his fists against his eyes. The young man across from us stood up and walked out the door. His children followed with their eyes but didn't stir from their seats. "Mother's legs did  heal," I reminded Father. "And now the two of you are having a grand time. You work together on art. You go to senior citizens every day. You take her out to dinner every now and then. So what does it matter what happened in the past?""The past," said Father uncovering his red, watery eyes. "That is where it all begins and ends. I keep thinking about it, turning it over in my head, but it defies me. Your mother abandoned her dream of being a doctor and became a teacher instead because it would be easier on her health. Yet she married me...." I took a tissue from the Kleenex box on the glass coffee table before us and held it up to Father. He ignored it. "You have no idea," he continued, "how hard it was for her when she first came to this country. She had to learn to cook and clean, things she had never before done. And then when your sister was born ... you have no idea how hard." He shook his head violently, like a wild tiger driven to mad distraction by the confinement of its cage. "If only she had been born poor, then maybe she would have been prepared for the fate I brought her to. But why me in the first place? We met but once, and she knew only through letters. Why not someone better, as she deserved? Did you know she had had another suitor in Taiwan? A high government official, a wealthy man like her father. So why not him?  It is yuan, I tell you. In a past life I knew her and something happened. Perhaps I helped her or her family, and she became indebted."It had, of course, nothing to do with debt or obligation or even love carried over from an earlier incarnation. Her destiny had been sealed in this life through nothing more than letters. Had she been duped? Had the true man hidden behind his words?"There is a curse on our family," said Father shaking his head morosely. "No there's not," I countered, suddenly gleaning the last piece to a puzzle. In Taiwan, one of Mother's students had fallen under suspicion for communist sedition. When she had defended the child, she had been implicated as well. Hence, she had to get away, flee the island. That was when she took the gamble of her life on a man she knew only through lies scribbled on stationary. Such was "yuan"--fate--politics and bad timing. "It all started with that fool Jin-cheng," said Father. "It had to do with a tiger in the mountains, a man-eater."I pictured again the coward at the kitchen table, glass of whiskey in hand. His liquor-tinged taunt rang loud in my ears: "Old General Lee, your daddy the warlord!" And once more I witnessed how the words struck Mother through. The old man shut tight his eyes and began pounding his head. "It had to do with blood and gold, dishonor and betrayal!""What are you talking about?" I moaned.Father tried to calm himself with deep breathes. "I think that sometimes a curse can assume human form like a fairy or gen." He clasped his hands together as though in prayer and raised them to his mouth. "The curse gains a life and consciousness of its own. It follows you, stalks you." He forced his hands down to his lap and turned to face me. "This one followed me out of the mountains. It followed me thousands of li across the breadth of China." He gave me a nod.  "The evidence of its mischief lies strewn across the decades of my life like automobile wreckage on one of these American highways.""Come on," I said as evenly as I could manage. "Tell me the story.""It is here," he insisted. "Right here in this room. Sitting beside me." He tapped the armrest of the empty chair beside him. "If I close my eyes I may even feel the gen's hot breath against my cheek!""Stop it with the curses and gens!" "You don't understand," said Father. "But how can you understand? You're an American! Your eyes see only what passes before them at this moment. My eyes look farther! It all started with Jin-cheng, who was my father's father." "Mother's fate is called cancer!" I screeched in my mind. "Science," cried Father, "can only deal with superficial symptoms! It takes more to get at ultimate cause. It takes looking at the past and sifting through a myriad of events, which is why we must use terms that relate to the past, terms that the past can understand."" If," I screamed into the empty sky of my private world, "you'd spent a fraction of the time looking forward as you did looking back, maybe things would be different today! Hindsight is rubbish! Foresight was the only thing that could have saved her! Because those damned, disgusting little grapes of cancer eating away her life belong to years of toil and hardship! The truth is you created her fate, this 'now'! You did! You did! You did!""Just tell the story!" I hissed. "Tell the story!"Jin-cheng was a fool, and because he knew this he attempted nothing beyond his limited abilities. That is why he never failed in the execution of his duties except for one instance.There came a time when a crippled tiger turned to hunting young children and old men. Jin-cheng engaged the services of a tracker, who took to the woods with a great host of soldiers and peasants. After a single day, the party returned with the man-eater's head, and in appreciation for this deliverance, Jin-cheng gave the hunter a large sack of copper coins and several fat bolts of brocade silk. The hunter, however, was very strongly of the opinion that the monster's head was worth its weight in gold.  His public complaints moved Jin-cheng to banish him from the district.  As a parting gesture, the hunter mounted a pedestal in Anshun's main market and cursed the house and line of his parsimonious patron.  Jin-cheng's male descendants would henceforth be born destined to die of starvation and the women to become imbeciles and lunatics.  Man-niang's medicinal herb business flourished. From out of her wealth emerged a large mansion with twenty-one chambers, two courtyards and four gardens.  As grand as this estate was, there is a limit to the power of wealth.  High mansion walls and armed guards cannot protect a family from everything.  The tiger hunter's curse soon began to work its dark magic.  Of Man-niang's three sons, the middle boy was the most naturally gifted. He seemed to have a talent for everything--painting, calligraphy, composition, music. His mind was in a continual whirl. But it was precisely this perpetual motion that made his education next to impossible.Every evening Man-niang sat with her sons as they studied the Confucian rites. She periodically asked for recitations from the text. In this exercise she trusted her eldest and youngest sons implicitly, but with the middle boy, she had one of his brothers follow along in the text.  When fraud was inevitably detected, the monitor shouted, "He's reading from imagination!" which earned the cheater a rap across the knuckles with a bamboo switch.One day at a family function, an adult cousin decided to have some fun at the expense of Man-niang's impressionable middle son. "You've seen the Miao tribes people before, haven't you?" he asked the boy.  Of course he had. Who could have not? The young Miao men came to market wearing baggy black trousers and black turbans.  The maddeningly beautiful Miao maidens hung great loops of silver round their necks.  "Well," continued the clever cousin, "if you ever notice a certain resemblance between yourself and any of these Miao ... do you suppose it could be pure coincidence?"The boy had on many occasions watched the young Miao men form singing lines before their maidens. He was well familiar with the men's bold melodies and unintelligible lyrics as well as the women's coy gestures. What tune had won the heart of his true mother?  That very evening, he confronted his sham parents with the truth. Had he been bought from the Miao? Or had Jin-cheng committed an indiscretion with one of their girls?  This snide recitation earned for him a severe caning. The boy became convinced of his lineage. In his mind, so ripe for fiction, not a doubt remained.  He was Miao. A cousin's mischief had bore perverse fruit, and from that time forward, compliance with Man-niang, the pretender, was out of the question.When Man-niang's boys reached early manhood, the eldest and youngest were sent to the provincial capital to sit for the regional civil service exams.  Both advanced to the national level exams, where again they performed exceptionally well and earned imperial commissions. It was a critical time for all young men of proven talent; the dynasty was dying. Yuan Shi-kai, a royal minister, was given the mandate to build a modern army, one that could stand up to Western invaders.  He opened an imperial military academy in Baoding, then capital of Hebei province. Among its elite officer cadets were Man-niang's two brilliant sons.As for the middle boy, who had grown up an ignoramus and a sloth, Man-niang could see nothing better for him than to negotiate a marriage with the daughter of a wealthy family and prop him up in a small business.In the middle son's first two years as a cloth merchant, two girls were born to him, but neither lived past infancy. I was the third to be born and first to survive.  What spared me was a providential escape from my mother's arms. At three day's age, I was delivered to my mother's mother for safekeeping.You see, by that juncture, my father's drinking and gambling had already brought his business to ruin. My mother was a silly woman who could no more cope with her husband's excesses than she could a baby's needs.  Her father, the local prison warden, suffered no remorse over his children's plight. He relieved them of a burdensome baby only because it slackened his wife's demands on his time.  I spent the first five years of my life in the opium den of a forgotten old woman. Eventually, my father would indeed starve to death and my mother succumb to madness.The late afternoon sun finally broke through the defeated, scattering storm clouds. The hospital grounds were suffused by a luxurious steam that rose from the grass. For me, no finer combination could be conceived than the cool air and warm sunshine. I walked all the way to the highway from which Hannover Medical Arts Center looked grander than Versailles. Mother's surgery that morning had been a total success!  As I made straight for the hospital's south entrance, the resolution to record on tape all the stories of both my parents was foremost on my mind.  Mother's trial had been too close a call for comfort.  It was now imperative to secure the family past for the family future. Or perhaps I simply wanted to lavish my folks with attention. The automatic doors of the south entrance swung open smartly, sparing me a bloody nose when I whimsically resolved not to slow down.  The senior citizen volunteer manning the gift shop wore a fetching scarlet jacket, which was reason enough for me to buy a Hersey's chocolate bar. My exit from the shop was stayed by the sweet scent of flowers. As I ripped open the wrapper of my Hersey's, I turned to discover a tall glass vase with long-stemmed blood-red roses. "Your father bought a dozen not fifteen minutes ago," informed the volunteer, whose name according to the lapel placard was Mrs. Daw."Oh, well," I said, "then that would be redundant, wouldn't it?"Mrs. Daw smiled a closed-mouth smile. "Of course," she said leaning back against the counter and tilting her head to one side, "extra roses never hurt any woman's recovery.""Hm ... but in this case, I think we'll be fine as we are.  A single stem may be precious, but two dozen of the same becomes a mob." With that I made a dash for the elevator.The corridors of obstetrics-gynecology were business as usual. As I walked I made appreciative assessments of the nurses in their single-piece uniforms. When I arrived at Mother's room, the door was wide open.  I strode in to find the dozen roses in a shiny aluminum water pitcher on the window sill, their crimson blooms all the more dazzling against the sky of scuttling clouds.  Mother lay asleep in her bed. A slender plastic tube ran from the middle of her arm across to a plastic bag dangling from a metal stand and half-filled with clear liquid. Father sat beside her in a chair, smiling and leaning forward as though listening to her convey secrets.I looked around the room. Mother's letters and notes were neatly stacked on her night stand. Her personal items--comb, lotion, etc.--had all been put away. The silk robe was draped over the back of the sofa chair. Father might have put it there in anticipation of a stroll with Mother around the ward after her awakening. I smiled at this naivete."She's been sound asleep since the operation," said Father in a hushed tone."What's the doctors say?" I asked. "Is that acceptable? Is it normal?""Oh yes," answered Father as confident and casual as an old medical pro. "Quite normal."I went to Mother's bedside. She looked pale, which was only to be expected. I told myself that the look on her face was one of serenity and well-being, but objectively, there was no expression.  I examined Mother's eyelids to see if her eyes shifted beneath them. They didn't seem to; apparently her sleep was dreamless. I supposed that Mother's two faithful guardians--the emperor's darling and the short general--would also have to wait to visit."Why don't you sit down," suggested Father. "It may be awhile yet."I took the robe to the closet and hung it up. Then I went to the sofa chair, sat down and leaned back, placing my hands on the armrests. I closed my eyes and before I knew it, I was a little boy again, sitting in Mother's lap. "What would you like to draw today?" she asked.I made a wish, and her fingers folded around my tiny hand. The crayon's waxy tip pressed into paper. Soon there appeared two large eyes, a snout and teeth, a big, striped body and long, rope-like tail.  A beast of the forest, tame to its creators."We are going back to China," chirped Father happily. I opened my eyes, and there lay my powerful gen, helpless as a baby. "And the pair of you will walk together through palace gardens in the capital." Perhaps the past didn't matter afterall. Curse indeed. The curse was broken.Two Skies     ved that the woman didn't retchI said curtly, ened to Man-niang and Jin-cheng.that minute:.W:|0.8|1.W:|.%& K P%%!%=%A%%&:&=''($(((=(?)))))))))****,>eAANRNUOhOmO{O|OOOOOOOOOOOOVWVwVxVVVVVVVVVVW.W/WMWO@P@X&'@)MqiPFcPf<kH | !"O"x$%%&&',(:)***+*,*,t.7/023N44567 pP ! pP ! pP !J777:%:<.=>e>f>g@A[C-CCDEUFGIGIIJ7KL>M#MTNMNOhO}O~OOOOVVVVW/WWWWZ;yttttttttttttt,Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C/p@$*0-/25p8@;=@C@p pP ! pP !-base from which to deal with the; I don't have a her legs were broken and burntthing to offer.

7#$,]2Y4W4WHHHHXHfHfHfHrHHHI.xHfI IM*NHMIMM]MMMMMMChapter 8: The Recollection of a Five-year OldIn the early afternoon of the second day after Mother's second surgery, we waited for the nurse to finish her medical chores and leave the room before starting the cassette recorder. Mother lay asleep in bed. I sat on the bed beside her. Father sat in his chair, and the slight curve of his pressed lips suggested a smile of deep satisfaction. His knees started to rock."I was draped from neck to foot in silk," he said softly."Ba," I said, "a bit louder and into the microphone."He looked up and nodded. Leaning forward and clearing his throat, he aimed his voice at the machine and began again."I wore a shirt and trousers made of emerald green silk, which matched perfectly the silk of my grandmother's morning gown. I was five years old, and I had always worn clothes that matched Grandmother's."Our chamber was normally dark, the shuttered window rarely opened, its curtains rarely parted. The kerosene lamp Grandmother kept on a wooden stand beside the bed had a blue-glass flame corset so that the light it threw cast everything in shades of blue. For an overly imaginative child, this tinted wash provided the illusion of living at the bottom of the sea. "On one side, the chamber wall was a grape trellis of mahogany. The opposite wall was a rose bush of ebony.  Beneath its full black blossoms was the bed, which dominated the room as a large pond might dominate a courtyard garden."The bed's canopy had curtains on all four sides. In the winter, these curtains were of duan silk, which was so thick that not a strand of light could thread their weave. When they were drawn you sometimes confused yourself as to whether it was day or night, even whether your eyes were open or shut! But now in summer, the curtains were of shi chou silk. Nearly transparent, they rippled with the slightest breeze."Grandmother spent her days either reclined upon her magnificent bed or propped up on a mass of pillows because she had devoted her plump old age to opium. "This then was the woman and the world that appeared before Man-niang as she appeared before us on an autumn morning three quarters of a century ago. I can still see her through green shi chou ; I can still hear the startled gasp of the maid servant who nonetheless parted the curtains and tied them in accordance with propriety."'Sister?' said Man-niang loudly."'Sister,' replied Grandmother in a faltering voice. 'How sweet of you to come.'"Man-niang's face wasn't smooth and round like Grandmother's; it was etched and wasted. Her hair wasn't black but white and tied in a bun so tight that I half expected beads of blood to well at the stems. Her puny frame was clothed in a blue cotton shirt and black cotton trousers. Her tiny bound feet weren't wrapped in white cotton strips and covered by emerald green silk booties but, rather, hidden inside ordinary hair-and-cloth-bottomed shoes. "Man-niang hobbled closer and asked, 'How have you been all this time?' "'Fine,' replied Grandmother."I sat beside the waterpipe, which was as long as I was tall.. On my head sat a black silk cap.  In my hands I clutched a red wooden dragon of twelve segments. Had Man-niang known no better she might have guessed I was three years old, so small and underdeveloped was my body."Looking at me critically she said, 'The young master's five this year, isn't he?'"'Yes indeed,' answered Grandmother with pride."'Five!' spat Man-niang. 'Why at that age one would think he'd be weaned of toys.'"'Five,' said Grandmother demurely, 'is a delicate age.' "Throwing back her head, her nostrils flaring, Man-niang challenged, 'By five my boys were applying themselves to the classics'"'And they all turned out so well,' said Grandmother quietly. With but the hint of a smile, she lowered her eyes and turned her head towards a chair beneath the shuttered and curtained window. Next to it stood a table whose slender legs were carved to look like a deer's', its reddish hue reminiscent of smeared blood."Smarting at the allusion to her middle son, her rival's son-in-law, Man-niang's eyes narrowed. 'The delicacy of the age,' she retorted, 'demands constant attention.'"'Much too constant,' answered Grandmother, suddenly gasping as though she had swallowed something vile and toxic."'Perhaps the lady requires a reprieve from her duties as a nanny!' quickly pursued Man-niang. "The maid servants who catered to Grandmother at all hours of the day and night usually seemed to me like porcelain figurines, so silent and unobtrusive did they stand by the side of the bed. But now before the intruder, the girl in attendance shrank back in fear as though confronted by a wild boar. "'Oh, no,' said my Grandmother shaking her head vehemently. 'Where my burden ends another's would begin.'"A ribbon of fragrant smoke rose from the stick of incense burning in its golden holder and disappeared into the shadows of the ceiling rafters. Man-niang said, 'A lady of society such as yourself must miss her freedom; whereas, high society is wasted on a mule like me. This life in captivity is a sentence to you, but I am accustomed to the shackles of childcare. I ask you, what is the company of a five-year old for wit and subtlety?' "'Perhaps the child's blitheness,' offered Grandmother defiantly, 'has more to recommend it than the weary stories of jaded women. I have retired from society--' "'Into a smoke-filled world of dreams!' shouted Man-Niang like a viper spraying venom."The maid servant fled the room, and the intruder darted a poisonous glance after her."Grandmother coolly replied, 'Perhaps, it is my Dear Sister who is deluded.' Opium had apparently sharpened Grandmother's wits, and Man-niang must have known that her rival could not be gotten around with mere words. The vexed intruder glared hostilely in my direction, and I twisted the little dragon around my wrist, staring back at her with mouth agape. "'Stop drooling!' she commanded. "I immediately shut my mouth and looked in confusion to my emerald green protectress. "'What use frightening the boy?' scolded Grandmother."'You haven't yet asked me the purpose of this visit!' said Man-niang impatiently."'I assumed that the purposes were courtesy, amusement and our mutual pleasure.'"Man-niang shuffled towards my side of the bed. 'On the contrary, Younger Sister,' she said in a calmer voice, 'I have come on business of an urgent nature.'"'Really, Older Sister," said my Grandmother, the anxiety in her voice mounting. 'Then I shan't keep you from it.' She propped herself up with both hands and looked about in search of an attendant. 'Little Wu?' she cried. 'Little Wu?' Raising herself still further, she shouted, 'Someone come! Come and escort our gracious guest to the master of the house!'"'The master is out,' announced Man-niang. 'My man saw his entourage ambling to market.  Do you suppose they went without him?'"'Then it seems you chose an inauspicious time for a visit.' Grandmother stared at her rival as a doe might at a tiger."'Shall you,' said Man-niang, 'assume authority in the master's absence? Or shall I?'"'State your business.' "'My business today is obviously this boy. His future.'"Grandmother laughed. 'You might have saved yourself the trip,' she said. 'My grandson's future is secure. We have seen to that.'"The girl servant reappeared at the chamber entrance, several older maids behind her. Ignoring their presence, Man-niang continued, 'If he stays here, his future is forfeit.' "'As long as I live,' vowed Grandmother taking courage at the sight of her troops, 'and even after I die, he will be well taken care of.' "Pounding her fist into her open hand, Man-niang shouted, 'Do you really suppose he'll last a month after you're gone?! Your husband will find one excuse or another to get rid of him!'"'NO!' screamed Grandmother."'YES!' boomed Man-niang. 'He'll have outlived his purpose, namely to distract you!... Little Sister, you can no more guarantee his future than I can guarantee the sky!  Security is never absolute, and when the sky dries and famine ravages the land, then the sheep die! Only the wolves survive!' "Grandmother shook her head, her lips quivering. 'They feast, no doubt, on the soft flesh of the poor sheep.' "'This boy,' proclaimed Man-niang, 'will learn to use his wits and will as a wolf uses its teeth and claws.  He will survive, if need be on the flesh of the likes of you.'"Man-niang came straight at me. I looked to my beloved guardian, and the intruder caught me by the wrist."'Grandma!' I cried."My protectress pleaded to Man-niang, 'I beg you, Mistress, I beg you! Let him go!'"'I will spare neither you nor myself,' said Man-niang. 'But the boy I will save.'"As she began to pull me from the bed, Grandmother snatched my other hand, and the rivals stretched me out between them.  "'Let go!' screeched my protectress. 'You're hurting him!' "'I'll rip him in two,' growled Man-niang, 'before I leave him here to rot!'"Man-niang yanked on my arm, and Grandmother let go. I was pulled out of the room and dragged down the corridor. The small platoon of maid servants followed us, begging for mercy.  Daggers must have driven into Man-niang's peach-sized feet with every step, but her will was forged of steel. The dying wails of my hapless Grandmother drilled into my brain. I might have bloodied my lungs shrieking. "By the time we reached the outer courtyard, the front of my collar was soaked with tears. Man-niang's crew of four peasant men in rough trousers and straw sandals were lounging around the pond.  Eight of our household manservants came out of the master's study on the other side of the courtyard."Without a word from their mistress, the bare-chested peasant men hurried to a sedan chair, grabbing hold of its poles. The household men quickly realized what was happening and joined the maids in appealing to Man-niang.  She pushed through the crowd gathered round her and climbed onto the sedan, lifting me up after her. In the next moment we were hoisted high into the air, above the grimy shoulders of the peasant carriers.  We flew through the open gates of the estate wall and floated down a narrow lane of closed doors."Though I continued to sob, I noticed the filth of the peasants' trousers. Soon a moist film covered their backs, and the ridges of their ribs began to glisten. Behind us followed a young maid servant dressed in a light blue tunic."Man-niang had chosen the hottest point of the afternoon for her raid.  The stones of the walls looked parched.  The mud in the gutters was caked. The dust thrown into the air by the plodding sedan carriers created a yellowish haze, and one of the men started coughing and hacking.  Man-niang tried to cool herself with a white paper fan.  "'No three skies without a cloud, no three steps without a stone, no three brothers without a bag of bones,' she muttered softly. I peeked at her and thought I saw a tear on her cheek. 'Those billowing clouds,' she said loudly to me but turning away, 'they look to be boiling a storm.  But so did the ones yesterday and the day before that. The sky does deceive.'"Two Skies     vbeganHe said softly, raped from neck to foot in silk."

7#$5[;@W@WKKKLtM?M?M?MKM[MwMwNxL}Ny NR*RKRNRR[RRRRRRChapter 9: LasixA push-cart stacked with electronic consoles stood next to Mother's bed. Three small rectangular screens on these consoles monitored her vital functions through moving signatures of jagged lines in incandescent amber. A plastic bag hanging from a steel stand near the head of her bed fed clear solution into her arm through a plastic tube. Another plastic bag, which dangled from a lower stand at the foot of her bed, collected yellow urine through a plastic tube that disappeared beneath her gown.  Mother's arms looked unusually plump, slightly reminiscent of an infant's. Her face was a little puffy as though she had small marshmallows stuffed inside her cheeks. The whites of her half-closed eyes were tinged with yellow. The minute heaves of her body made me think of a beach-stranded porpoise teased by the surf.  I watched the random tics of her head and limbs."Mama," said Father in a low voice. He sat by the head of her bed, leaning close to her, smiling.Mother nodded and made a feeble attempt to pull out the tube in her nose."No, Mama," said Father gently. "That's there to help you."Mother frowned and nodded. She opened her eyes and looked from me to Father."Have you eaten yet?" she asked."Yes," answered Father. "We had a wonderful lunch in the hospital cafeteria."Mother smiled and then closed her eyes. She patted his hand. Then she frowned again and tilted her head to one side. "When is the operation?" she asked."Why, don't you remember?" asked Father. "That was yesterday morning; the operation is already over."I sat at the edge of Mother's bed. Father turned to me, an urgent look straining his face."The house," said Mother."Guang Guang was just there," said Father in an almost pleading tone. "He returned the day before the operation."Mother briefly opened her eyes."Everything's alright at the house," insisted Father."I checked all the locks and lights a second time before leaving," I reported. "And I made sure the stove and oven were turned off.""Yes," said Father, rubbing the back of her hand. "So you see, the house hasn't burned down.""And even if it did," I said. "You'd be the first to know."Mother laughed softly at this, but then a weak cough took possession of her. After some time, the cough subsided."I'll be alright," she reassured us, managing to open her eyes wide and sustain a smile. She focused on me and said, "I won't die this time." Turning to Father she continued, "but you will unless you take care of yourself.... You're eighty-one. Unless you eat properly and get plenty of rest, you'll catch pneumonia."Father answered gratefully, "Yes." Then he chuckled and shook his head. "When you get better, we'll go back to China together. I'll take you to Sichuan, and we'll find your old home.""Alright," said Mother closing her eyes again. The smile faded.Father rubbed her hands, then started working her fingers between his."Maybe there's still a plantation there," I remarked."I don't see why not," chimed Father looking up at me with a brave smile. "And I'm confident that most of the old family will still be there too. I mean, where would they have gone? Mama has plenty of brothers and sisters, who will be looking forward to her return. Plenty of nephews and nieces looking forward to meeting her for the first time!" When Father's statements didn't elicit an immediate response, bright optimism fled from his face, his expression clouded over. He stuffed the tip of his beard into his mouth, but moments later, he chuckled and piped up, "We'll also see her second and third mothers, my mothers-in-law. How many men are lucky enough to have had three mothers-in-law?!"Mother smiled."Why, I'll bet third mother-in-law is younger than I am!" He began to twist his beard in his fingers.  "It'll be a splendid homecoming! A reunion to remember!""I'd like to see my brother one more time," whispered Mother. "My first brother. The one I used to bathe in a small metal wash basin when he was no bigger than a basketball.... I taught him how to read, I taught him how to write. I helped take care of him when he was sick.""Of course," said Father. "Of course." He shook his head and knocked it with the flat of his palm. "I'll write to him tomorrow. Tomorrow, tomorrow.""And can we bring Guang-yu along?" Mother struggled to ask."Yes, yes," instantly answered Father, "of course. Ping-yu too. Both your son and your daughter.""Good," said Mother seemingly relieved. "Thank you.""Why do you thank me?" he gently admonished. "Thank you's are for strangers. Not the two of us."I pictured mighty Mount Emei, it's rocky peak rising high above the forest canopy. Up its stepped path ascended my parents, Mother riding a sedan chair carried by two mountain runners and Father walking along beside. Flat-headed monkeys, big as little boys, escorted the party and periodically reached into Father's pockets for peanuts.  At each vista they paused, and Mother looked out over the panorama to find the tiny yellow and green patches that were the fields and forests of her childhood.... Then I saw her as a little girl again, watching over her baby brother.My daydream was disrupted by Dr. Wong, who entered the room with a nurse. Somewhat to my surprise, Father did not sit up and assume a formal air but remained hunched over with Mother's hand clasped in his. He did, however, look up at the young physician, who gave him a quick nod of acknowledgment.As the nurse took Mother's temperature and blood pressure, Dr. Wong examined her charts, glancing up occasionally at one of the electronic monitoring screens or plastic bags of fluid.Father looked at me as though to say, "What do you think?"I shrugged my shoulders. With clipboard in hand, Dr. Wong walked around the bed, followed by his nurse. He smiled at Father, and Father pushed his chair back out of his way. Then Dr. Wong stepped into the vacated spot and leaned forward. Mother seemed strangely oblivious to the doctor and nurse."Hello, Mrs. Zhou," he said clearly and loudly.Mother opened her eyes in a start and said, "Hello.""How are you today?""Fine.""That's good," said Dr. Wong with a grin and vigorous nod of his head.The nurse carefully clamped Mother's urine tube and then removed the full bag to replace it with an empty one. "I'm just going to listen to your heart," said Dr. Wong showing Mother the round, stainless steel disk of his stethoscope. Mother nodded consent, and he proceeded with his examination, grinning, with his head turned to one side. Father arched his arms and planted his hands on his knees. As Dr. Wong raised himself again, Father said in English, "Please. Excuse me. How does it sound?""Good," said Dr. Wong looking to Father. "She sounds good."Father pursed his lips and nodded hopefully.Dr. Wong turned back to Mother, leaned over and said with a broad smile, "You sound good, Mrs. Zhou."Mother started a second time as she opened her eyes and said, "Thank you." "You're going to be fine," said Dr. Wong, his head bobbing up and down. "It's just a matter of time now. It takes time to heal. In the meanwhile, we'll do the best we can to make you comfortable." With this, he side-stepped away from Mother.Father looked to me and smiled. I smiled back. He slid his chair forward again."Did you hear that?" he asked Mother. "You're going to be alright. It may be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you're going to get well."Mother kept her eyes shut. She smiled and shook Father's hands.I followed Dr. Wong out the door and stood at a short distance as he issued instructions to a nurse. When he'd finished, the nurse rushed off, and he immediately marched away at a brisk pace.  "Excuse me, Doctor Wong," I called, catching him up in front of the glass-enclosed nurses' station. Swinging round to face me he said, "Yes?""I was just wondering if there's anything you can give my mom to help her sleep. Ever since she regained consciousness, she hasn't really been able to sleep.""She's already on something to help her relax," said Dr. Wong. "I can increase the dosage a little, but we don't really want to push it. Her system's receiving enough chemicals.""I understand that," I said. "But maybe if you could just lower her body temperature a bit. She's red, she's constantly moist with perspiration and hot to the touch. I mean when I'm hot, I can't sleep. I know my mother's hot, and I watch her tossing and turning. I mean, I don't see how her system can recover unless she gets some sleep. Perhaps I'm being naive, doctor, but do I make any sense?"Dr. Wong hugged his clipboard with both arms, pressing it over his heart. "Yes, I'm afraid you do," he conceded. "Unfortunately, at this stage there's not much I can do about body temperature. I can give her something to try to regulate it a little better, but her heat is mainly due to lasix, which she has to have if the system's going to rid itself of excess fluid.  As you can see, she's bloated.""Is that what's in that clear bag?" I asked. "Lasix?""Yes," confirmed Dr. Wong."And that's why she's producing so much urine?""Yes."Dr. Wong's face was perfectly still as he awaited my next question. I remember thinking that his large black eyes might have been made of glass."I can appreciate that excess fluid may not be good for her system," I said, "but maybe right now she needs rest more than anything else. I don't see how she'll recover without rest."Sighing in exasperation, Dr. Wong said, "She needs rest, yes, but excess fluid can place a severe strain on the heart. At this point the lasix is crucial and sleep is secondary. I can appreciate that her fatigue disturbs to you, but if circulatory pressure becomes overwhelming then her heart will stop. That I simply can't afford.""No," I said. "Neither can my mother."Without another word, the medical resident turned and walked away.I returned to Mother's room. Father still sat beside her, holding her hand. His eyes were now shut, the rocking of his knees barely noticeable. The white gauze curtains I had brought from home muffled the sunlight streaming in through the picture windows, glazing both my parents with a muted luminescence.  Though neither of them smiled, their faces looked happy.  Serene and content. I fancied that they were lost in a shared dream. After five days of sleep deprivation my mother was seeing things."Up there," she said pointing blithely at the white ceiling."Where?" I asked looking up. "What is it?"Father, Dr. Wong, the portly Dr. Bravo and the well-dressed Dr. Belamy searched the ceiling together."Those people," said Mother, narrowing her eyes and turning her head to one side.  She looked up again, smiling graciously. "Are they doctors?" Her body was still bloated by fluid, but she was far less agitated. "Can you describe these doctors?" I asked.She turned to me and then to Father. Pointing at the ceiling again she quietly asked, "Don't you see them?""Yes," answered Dr. Belamy. "They are there.""A black man and a woman?" said Mother."Is the woman black too?" I asked. "No," answered Mother obliviously."Are they dressed as doctors?" asked Dr. Belamy. Fingering the lapel of his white lab coat. "Are they wearing things like I and Dr. Wong?"Mother shook her head. "They are beautifully dressed," she said. "All in white. Aren't they your doctors?" Father looked gravely at me."They are guests," said Dr. Belamy. "From another hospital.""Oh," said Mother lowering her arm. "I see." She nodded with satisfaction and shut her eyes.I laid my hand on hers. Her skin was hot and dry.Father began to pat her shoulder. He whispered into her ear. "Don't trouble yourself over the visitors; don't think of them.  Don't even think of them. You have to worry about yourself. You need to rest.... Rest."The doctors and nurses returned to their discussion of her vital signs and the progress report. Once finished, they left quietly as a group, taking care not to rouse Mother. I followed them out.  "Dr. Belamy," I said.  The group stopped, and Dr. Belamy signaled with his hand for the nurses to go ahead without the doctors. "Your mother's doing reasonably well," offered Dr. Wong. "Her signs are not pessimistic."I searched Dr. Belamy's eyes, but found nothing. Not fear or worry or concern. "She hasn't slept in five days," I said to him. "I think it's the lasix. It raises her body temperature so high that she's always too hot to fall asleep. I don't see how she can get better unless she gets some rest."Dr. Belamy nodded and gazed down at the floor. "Dr. Wong," he said, "what is her current dosage?""Sixty cc's," he replied, causing his superior to raise a brow."The large dosage doesn't seem to be having a dramatic effect," said Dr. Belamy. "I don't think we have too much to lose by lowering the dosage, do you?""No," agreed Dr. Wong."Let's cut back to thirty cc's and see what happens." "Very good," said Dr. Wong.Dr. Bravo grinned and gave me a little nod."Thank you," I said to him."Not at all," he answered. "Is there anything else?" "No," I said.After excusing himself and his colleagues, he walked away down the hall accompanied by Dr. Bravo while Dr. Wong summoned a nurse to inform her of the change.That night Mother still could not fall asleep, but I realized that the benefits of reduced dosage would take time to manifest themselves. The next morning I returned home.Two Skies     vX!!/u/y5555555@W@@@@@@@@@@@A!A%A9AHAIAdAeAfAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBCCCCC&C'C+C,C`CaCCCCCCCDDD0DXDYDgDhDDDDDDDDDD@P@Z-j)*5lQ@:t%v_$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $ pP $$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $"%9oDp)e_U'tgI ~!2"$S$w``$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $%$$$$%q&*'x''))))**H*++,,M,v,,-K--..r./|0B0[01!2J2233334#4@4w45%5wwww$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $$ pP $.5555555@AIAeAfAABBBBBBBCCC'C,CaDYDEHHH/HfHI?IIJ5J6J7J8J:JQJcJhJJKKKKK pP $,$Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C/p$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@$p2A porpoise wanting to return to the sea or maybe a porpoise too dehydrated and deprivated to wish for anything, including feeling better.my mother'sexpressionlacelse ght optimism fled from his face andbig , like a salesman's,before removing the full bag and replacingwatch her tossing and turning.unsmiling simply around and walked away, leaving standing by myself in the hospital corridor. of homecoming in China Please rest.ignored Dr. Wong.

7#$BPAJWJWJWJWJWJetJJJJJJJKxJL L#PY*P[JWPYL9 PYPYPPYPYPYPYPYPYChapter 10: Late at Night; The Bed WetterWhether I was at the medical center or back home, I was frequently unable to rest well at nights. I would lie in bed and look up at the ceiling, study the walls, gaze out the window.As a child, I had suffered the occasional insomnia after drinking too much orange juice too late in the day, which sent me to the toilet a dozen times in the hour. I was fine once I learned to avoid this trap, so it wasn't until graduate school that I again started losing sleep. Then the drink that robbed me of rest was self-doubt. What was I doing in grad school, which I hated?  Where was it taking me?Now that I was finally rid of not only orange juice but school, I was impatient for change. I felt confident that someday I would be making a decent living in a satisfying job, and while Australian girls had looked right through me, American girls seemed to see somebody there, perhaps even a young man with possibilities.  I'm ashamed to say that what kept me up some nights was not my mother's plight so much as my own future. I would have a happy life. I would be a good husband and father, not a "visionary", a dreamer, a disappointment. Previewing in a hundred different incarnations the life to come was a pleasure I sometimes found impossible to resist.On the evening I got back home from Bitterfield I fell prey to this now usual temptation. As sweet as my fantasies were, I needed rest for the morning's drive back to the medical center. So I got out of bed to seek diversion.I tried television, but the late-night talk-show fare was boring, doing nothing to put dreamy ambition to bed. A magazine might have been better, but my parents carried no English-language subscriptions. As I searched the dining room for one of my old sports magazines, I suddenly thought of the cassette recorder and Father's tapes tucked away in my day bag. I fetched the bag and brought it to my room. I slipped a tape into the recorder and turned the recorder on.China at the time of my childhood was a medieval country with but one modern army. Five great scholars sought to convince the Emperor Guangxu that this sole brigade armed with guns instead of just swords and spears and bows and arrows was not enough to save the country. China's continued decline would ultimately lead to her complete dismemberment by the Western powers. The perilous situation called for drastic change. Eventually, the Emperor resolved to embrace democracy.The Emperor's five scholar-counselors confided the ambitious design to Yuan Shi-kai, marshal of the modernized forces, in hopes of winning his critical support. Before a constitution could be drawn up, however, Marshal Yuan betrayed the cause to the "Queen Grandmother" Dowager Cixi.  The five scholars were beheaded. The Emperor was confined to his palace without the comfort of his concubines.With time, the Emperor developed open sores on his body, which his physician attributed to small pox. The physician couldn't very well report the truth to Dowager Cixi, namely that her grandson had contracted disease from a prostitute or one of his own eunuchs. Consequently, the Emperor was treated for smallpox, and Cixi spread rumors of his grave condition. Wary of the Dowager, the Western powers intervened to save the impotent monarch since their extortionist treaties with China might possibly depend upon his survival. But this rescue was short-lived.One late-autumn day in 1908, it was proclaimed to the world that Emperor Guangxu, who had been in fine health ever since his "small pox", had died the day before. As a result, a three year-old boy ascended to the throne.All this, of course, was as yet remote to my family in the remote southwestern mountains. For us, it was a time not of portentous events but of modest fortunes.  Man-niang's youngest son Ai-wu was appointed to Guizhou's military staff, and the governor provided him with a large estate in the provincial capital Guiyang. The estate's back wall formed part of the perimeter of the provincial prison, which fell under Ai-wu's jurisdiction.Ai-wu had married a few years earlier. Although he and his wife were as yet childless, Man-niang and Jin-cheng moved in with them.  Certainly Ai-wu's star was too lucky for children to be far behind, and once the family expanded, how could the household possibly get by without grandparents?From a slightly different perspective, famine was eating Anshun to the bone. Jin-cheng feared the envy of the rabble. Since his retirement, his personal guard had been whittled down by the local magistrate to a few aging sergeants. Ai-wu, on the other hand, had at his disposal the finest troops in the province.  His estate was secure to say the least. It was to this expectant and protected household that Man-niang brought me, her reclaimed grandson.Ai-wu, whom I called Second Uncle, and his wife welcomed me as the son they so longingly awaited. I was lavished with attention and made to share their bed at nights.  Into this cozy picture, unfortunately, intruded my soggy tendency to wet the bed. Ai-wu and his wife endured for a month, but after that, Grandmother Man-niang assumed personal responsibility for my discipline. Thereafter, I slept with her.  Now when I awoke in the middle of the night, I went to the urine urn set in a storeroom at the end of a corridor.  The problem was that this storeroom required courage as it was windowless and illuminated only by a single candle set in the corridor at a small distance from the storeroom's entrance. Whenever natural process could be forestalled, I dashed out into the back courtyard and relieved myself in the flower beds.  The moon and stars made the night far less intimidating than the storeroom.  There were still times when I was too much in a drowsy stupor to manage either the urine urn or the flower beds.  Then I relieved myself where and how I was, namely supine upon my grandmother's bed.  After this had happened a number of times, Man-niang issued a warning: unless the bed-wetting immediately stopped, I would soon find myself sleeping alone in a small shed by the back perimeter wall.Night after night, I entreated myself, I begged myself, I promised myself not to wet the bed. I doubled my resolve to reach either the urn or the flowers. Despite this ardor, this sincere effort, there were still mornings when I awoke on cold, drenched, incriminating sheets. When this had happened five times, I was banished to the shed.On the first evening of sentence, a young handmaid led me to my new bed chamber. As we walked the stone path through the courtyard, I looked up to see that the moon was a brilliant, slender crescent. Just ahead of me, the handmaid made her way with the stealth of a cat."Please," I said, "stay with me at least until I fall asleep." The handmaid didn't answer or even pause to show that she had heard what had been requested of her, and I lacked the courage to repeat myself.When we reached the shed, the handmaid pushed open the door and passed her candle into the darkness. A weak, flickering light revealed a small bed and wooden stool in the middle of the room, an empty ceramic liquor jar set in a corner for my convenience. The windowless brick walls were bare. A few grains of corn were conspicuous on the hard-packed clay floor.  There was a pattering overhead; the handmaid and I cocked our heads to look up at the ceiling of coarse wooden strips supporting row upon row of ceramic tiles, their coarse undersides quite plainly visible. After a moment, the maid looked down at me and said, "Alright. Until you fall asleep. But just this once and only until you fall asleep." She set her candle down on the ground and helped me into bed. She tucked the covers around my shoulders and squatted down on the small stool.I shut my eyes and tried to stay still. But as I was desperate to fall asleep, I remained hopelessly, totally awake. I made it a point to stir ever so often for the handmaid's benefit. Nevertheless, after what seemed an hour but realistically might have been no more than fifteen minutes she rose to her feet."Wait!" I burst out, sitting up in a shot. "You can't  leave yet. I'm still not asleep.""I'm sorry, Young Master, truly I am. But I've got to go. Your grandmother will be expecting me." Fishing in her pockets, the handmaid produced a piece of candy wrapped in bright red paper. "Here," she said. "You can have this. I'll also leave the candle. The flame will keep you company." Without another word, the handmaid hurried out the door. I called after her, but she did not return.I watched the flickering light of the candle and darted occasional glances at the walls upon which I felt certain an unaccountable shadow would appear. When the candle burned down, I pulled the covers over my head and only fell asleep when fatigue finally overtook me. That night I did not wet my bed.The doors of the estate were now closed to me. Second Uncle and his wife shut me out of their chambers. My grandparents did the same. Like a homeless dog, I found my way to the kitchen, where the cooks and servants threw me scraps of attention. It wasn't long before they started teasing me and telling me stories. My mischief revived and I was back to my antics until one day Grandfather Jin-cheng caught me at my fun and games with the hired help and led me to his study.As we entered the dimly lit chamber he asked, "You have nothing to do with yourself?"I countered, "I've got plenty to do." Ignoring my smart remark, he gripped my shoulders with his strong hands and firmly guided me into the chair before his wide table and set down before me a thin book. Leafing through the flimsy volume, he stopped at a page with a four-line Tang couplet and ordered me to "Commit this to memory."I read the couplet over twice and announced, "I'm done."My grandfather sneered. "Don't be stupid."  Without batting an eyelash and not allowing my focus to stray an inch from the old man's gaze I recited the simple couplet loudly and clearly. Not amused, my grandfather gave me a second couplet, and in a few seconds, this too was memorized.With the fourth poem, I was still confident that successful recitation would result in my release. By the eighth poem, a sneaking suspicion and doubt had crept into my mind. After the fifteenth poem, I realized that this was a trap, a prison; I would not be set free again. I stared at the sixteenth couplet as though without comprehension."Memorize it," commanded my grandfather, and I ignored him. "Recite it," he barked. I uttered not a word. A hard slap to the back of my head triggered recitation, but the words seared my pride. The seventeenth poem took forever; not even a beating with a long, thin cane could induce accurate recitation.I choked on my tears; I would not let the decrepit old man see me cry. My grandfather said, "No wonder he spends his time in the kitchen with the servants; he's cut from the same cloth." In disgust, he threw his switch on the table and started pacing back and forth in front of me. "We should have sent him home," he muttered, "to that useless mother of his." My grandfather paused before me. He bent over and peered, sneering, into my face. His breath was as foul as rotten fish."This pathetic performance today," he said spraying my face with spittle as he talked, "simply confirms my conviction that education is as much a waste on this idiot as it was on that dung heap of a father of his. Simply isn't worth it. The trouble, the money, the worry. Not worth it at all." He looked away and stood up straight again. He resumed his senseless march back and forth across the study floor. I, sitting on that hard wooden chair, stared imbecilically at the Tang couplet in the thin book quivering in my small hands.As the days wore on, my insomnia persisted and I grew thin. But deep down inside, I began to forge a will.  Now whenever my grandfather brought me to his desk and set a text before me, I obstructed memorization by forcing my mind to wander. With an enemy, I would never comply. The brief respites in the kitchen I still managed to steal found me dumbly seated in a stool, unable to laugh or even smile at the jokes and stories of my friends.Grandmother Man-niang became increasingly occupied with her business ventures, so she all but forgot about me. No longer was I included when Second Uncle bought new clothes for the family or when Grandfather Jin-cheng treated everybody to an evening at the drama house. No longer was I given candy, even by the cooks and servants, who had been warned about being overly friendly with the family's youngest master. I ate sweets only when I scavenged pieces that neighborhood children dropped on the ground.  How familiar did become the gritty texture of dirt in my mouth and the taste of ants. One afternoon after my release from poetic torture, I wandered into the kitchen to talk with the cooks. As they were busy with the preparation a banquet, they had little attention to spare. When I tired of neglect, I left the kitchen and made my way towards the back courtyard, where I was surprised to find a "U"-shaped breech in the wall but a few short paces from the shed in which I slept. A great pile of toppled bricks lay upon a bed of crushed flowers.Had there been a crack in the wall earlier? What exactly had the destroyed flowers looked like? I couldn't quite recall even though I had urinated on them countless times in the past. What force had broken the wall? What lay on the other side? This final question broke the spell, and my feet slowly advanced towards the breech.A faint, familiar sound from the other side caused me to stop. I frowned and bowed my head, trying to match the sound to past experience. Then it came to me in a flash: creaking wood! I smiled in triumph and ran to the gap in the wall, getting on my hands and feet to climb the pile of bricks. Reaching the top, I raised my head, and what I saw struck the grin from my face. In the prison yard, from a tall wooden scaffold, hung a dead man.  Its neck was broken and stretched, its lifeless limbs were totally relaxed. Its long, gray tongue hung down from its mouth. It was unshaven and unwashed.  Flies marched over its face and congregated at the wells of its open, bulging eyes.  Its whiskers were like pigs' bristles; its whiskers stood straight out like soldiers shouted to attention, the searing moment of release, the violent separation implemented by the rope's tension and gravity, the snapping of the neck having screamed the order to attention for those soldiers that were pig's bristles, a dead man's whiskers. Its hands were tied behind its back; its clothes were gray rags; the bottoms of its bare feet were light brown with caked mud. Dangling at the end of a coarse rope, its gently shifting weight troubled the scaffold, causing the structure to moan. Its pigtail was coiled around its neck and the knot of its noose. Its bulging eyes glared aimlessly at nothing.Slowly the corpse turned. Its blind focus fell upon me, innocent witness from the other side of the wall. Its blind focus bored through my head and lodged once again in nothing. Death had pushed the wall over, for a convict's spirit, ripped from his body by the irresistible tug of the executioner's cord was compelled to find its own miserable way to heaven or to hell. Death directed that poor ghost through the hole in the wall, through the yard and gardens and into my shed, its tomb. I covered my eyes with my hands and rushed back into the house. From between my fingers seeped warm salt tears.  For the moment at least, the hanged man's ghostly breath smelled of the fragrance of rotting roses. I would sleep no more at nights save when several days' wakefulness overwhelmed me. The unwelcome light of dawn and the twitters and whistels of the hated waking birds wetted my face with tears of frustration, despair and relief. When I turned off the cassette player, it was just past one in the morning. I went outside and walked the empty streets. After an hour, I came home and went to bed.  It seemed as though I had just fallen asleep when the phone rang.  It was Father. Mother was in emergency surgery. I was on the highway by three, and sometime before dawn, I reached the surgery waiting room to find Father sitting in a chair with his hands braced against his knees. I sat down beside him. He was biting his beard and staring at the floor. His eyes were red and watery.  He told me what had happened, and then we sat in the silence. I and this old man who had long long ago been a small boy brutalized by neglect and a foolish old man. As before, the two of us simply waited.Two Skies     vawn and the twitters and whistle(~$A8~8Hu$;(@($A$4A88K88H$;(@|X8!P|aN |!|y^A888K(A88H1^,@8K8H8!@|N |A!;|~yA(A`~H 8~H]8}K!/1!!?BBBBBBBBB@P@01<mK'fghxG !-"###%&&@'h''(*+K+,,k,-5.]/M/N/OpP  pP $ pP $ pP $ pP $8/O13]5*6t7:v;=???AIBBBBBBBBBxsss,Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C/p$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@p pP $ pP $A@BK -'2];APK@LPM@NPO5@PPQ@RB"/OB#$U/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH@R(HH@H @@'=/BKH-: HP DeskJetFNew YorkGenevaMonacoPalatinoTimesHelveticaCourierSymbolMishawakaMishawaka BoldUTrebuchet MSArialCharcoalCapitalsSandCourier NewTechnoMonotype SortsTimes New RomanWingdingsHoefler TextHoefler Text OrnamentsImpactSkiaTextileGadgetApple ChanceryMT ExtraComic Sans MS/BrushScrDKBalloonDExtBoliCooperBlaDDomCasualDRegParkAveDAndale Mono#VerdanaBernhardFasDURWImperialTRegEurostileTBlaExtURWBodoniTReg MicrogrammaDMedExt CNevisonCasD ENicolasCocTReg OkayD OldEnglishD!PlaybillD!SpringfieldD"VAGRundschriftD"WindsorDReg$*BrodyJoiD$6HogarthScrJoiD$BVladimirScrJoiD%Missy BT%Liorah BT%Ryan BT%Hank BT%Melanie BT/-Arial Black/Georgia6ArabBruD7Webdings7BlacklightD9ChesterfieldAntD9GilliesAntDBol:DLegerD:eColumnaSolSCD:GoudySwaTLigIta:CoronetI?ChicagoVT100>*>*>*( X>>*AAAAAB?*BBBB

7#$0=:W:We4e4e4eBfg(g(g(g4.gb"gghxeh hl*le4lhll,llllllChapter 11: Celebrating at the MacLaughlins'Even though it was nine at night, I had no doubt that the front door was unlocked. Mr. MacLaughlin had reassured us of it, and he struck me as a plain-spoken man. Be that as it may, I still knocked on the door window and waited for either him or his wife to let us in. After a minute or so, a young man of medium build, thinning hair and a Fu Manchu mustache appeared on the other side of the window's yellowing lace curtain.Mr. MacLaughlin opened the door with a smile. I thanked him, and Father offered a few pleasantries before we moved on through the foyer. We passed into the living room, where Mrs. MacLaughlin sat watching television.  Wearing a white quilt night robe and with her brown hair tied into a bun, she looked misplaced in the 1980's. Cradled in her arms was chubby little Teddy MacLaughlin, who rolled his eyes and drooled unbecomingly."Just fed?" I asked.Mrs. MacLaughlin smiled. "Uh-huh."Father, with a brown bag quite conspicuously containing a bottle clutched in his hand, marched across the room to admire the lad. "Oh, little baby," he said. "How many months?""Four," Mrs. MacLaughlin answered proudly.I glanced at the walls and their framed prints of clipper ships at sea and flowers in vases, all of which looked monochrome in the television's blue glow. My eyes were drawn to the television set, on which was playing a situation comedy that I had not ever seen before but had heard or read somewhere was decent."May I hold him?" asked Father."Well ..." said Mrs. Maclaughlin looking uncertainly to her husband, who smiled back at his wife and nodded reassuringly. "Sure," he told my father."Yie yie yie," sang the old man as he laid the bottle down on the sofa and hoisted young Teddy up. "Wha wha wha. Ho-chi ho-chi ho-chi-chi-chi." Mrs. MacLaughlin's cautious smile betrayed a mixture of concern and delight. Father's gibberish and gentle bouncing quickly brought the hint of a grin to Teddy's face, in spite of his milk stupor. I could see that the 1960's Mom was quite favorably impressed.  I picked up our bottle, and when Father was done, I led him upstairs.The first thing we did upon reaching our room and taking off our jackets was to retrieve water glasses from the bathroom.  Then we closed the door and broke out the Jim Beam. As Father filled the glasses he said, "I know you can drink because I remember the trip we took to China five years ago. You could drink half a bowl of Chinese white spirits for lunch and walk as straight as an arrow afterwards." Our room was simple but clean. The furnishings consisted of two single beds with double-stacked mattresses, a night stand between the beds, a dresser with large mirror, two chairs and several small oval rugs. "You were just a boy," repeated Father, "so I didn't encourage your drinking. I didn't dare because your mother would have disapproved, would have reckoned with me. But now things are different. You have returned from Australia a scholar. So you can drink whenever you like and as much or as little as you like! Tonight, however, I request that you drink deeply. Your father requests this of you."Still standing, he handed me a glass, and we toasted the night. Less than two hours ago, Dr. Bravo had emerged from the critical care unit to inform us of the Mother's successful emergency surgery. Father refilled my glass. Lifting the bottle into the air, he proclaimed, "Never before in our family's history have we faced so dark a moment, so perilous a trial, yet we have emerged intact."I drained my glass as Father drank from the bottle."Sit down," I told him, and he obediently shuffled to his bed and sat down on the mattress. I sat down opposite him on my bed."Your mother has three to five more years of life," he said with a voice now devoid of its usual strength and resonance. "And ... in the time left to her ...""Ba," I said using the Mandarin equivalent of 'Dad'.Father put the bottle down on the night stand and covered his face with a hand. With the other hand he waved off my sympathetic restraint. "No, no," he said. "I know how difficult I've been all these years. I'm the type of person who likes a drink before dinner. Not much, a glass or two, but still when I swallow spirits, it makes me want to pick a fight." Certainly I felt a buzz, but it surprised me that Father was already apparently soaked to his sentimental core. Although we had stopped at a downtown bar for a few shots before coming home and were now putting away the whiskey at a brisk rate, the amount drunk so far might normally have amounted to a warm up for the troglodyte. Afterall, the man had been weaned on Chinese white spirits, half again as potent as American whiskey."Your mother would have had a much easier life without me," he said. "I made her life hard, hard, hard." He shook his head and quickly picked up the bottle again for another draught."Ba," I said."Give me your glass.""Uh, Ba. Wouldn't it be better if we made the bottle last?""Come on, boy, come on!" he said with bravado. "How many times in a life will you have such occasion for thanks? Don't begrudge fate the toasts we owe her." He paused briefly before resuming, "Are you sure this isn't too much for you?" After a moment more, the raffish smile returned to his face. "We've won a great victory today," he concluded. "Pass me your glass!  A great victory! Your mother beat the odds. She beat death itself!  Tricked him up a tree just like the old man in the legend. She did the impossible." His voice began to falter again as he added, "Just as she always has."I hadn't the heart to remind him that in the legend death had had the final laugh when he finagled his way out of the tree and tricked the man into forfeiture of his life. Looking uneasily at the door for fear that we were being too noisy, I handed Father my glass. He filled it to the brim. At the very least we weren't jumping up and down on the floorboards."We have a tidy nest egg, boy. Very tidy. But not because of me. Since I married your mother thirty years ago I've never earned more than a technician's wage, and I lost a great deal on the stock market.  Once more than ten thousand ...." His voice was now a whisper.  "But when I finally let your mother ...  when finally I listened to her, our fortunes changed." He gave me back my drink and held out his empty hand, tickling the air with his fingers in a signal for me to pass him something."What?" I asked."The glass," he said. "I need my glass.""Oh," I answered. Resisting the temptation to ask "What's wrong with the bottle?" I did his biding. Pouring himself another round, he said "I have a Ph.D. in economics, but what does it mean?" He frowned and shrugged his shoulders. "Nothing," he pronounced, putting the bottle down on the night stand again with a resounding thump. "I'm like my father: a gambler. When the stocks go up, I wait for them to peak. But after they peak and begin to go down again, I hold onto them even tighter than ever before."Keeping my gaze riveted to the old man, I quickly reached over and lifted the bottle and glanced beneath it to see if the impact had left a mark on the night stand; it hadn't. Relieved, I sat back again.  "It's all a great lie I tell myself," said the troglodyte. "'Maybe they'll climb back up?' I say, and the fool listens. Your mother on the other hand." He smiled and shook his head in admiration. "Didn't you make a big killing that once," I noted, "when you kept buying that technology stock ... um ... what's-it-called when everybody else was dumping it because it had hit rock bottom? Then it shot back up!" He dismissed my allusion with a perfunctory wave. "Your mother's character is like her father's. Had she been born a man, she would have commanded armies!  When the stocks are low, she buys.  When they're high, she sells.  No hesitation, no fear. The marvelous thing is that the stocks she buys always rise very high, and she never fails to sell just before they peak.  How does she do it?" He shook his head again and chuckled. "She says she reads the newspapers, but there's something more to it than that, you know. There are those born under a lucky star and those born with an eye in the future.  At birth your mother was doubly blessed. She simply knows."Father suddenly started sobbing, dropping his glass on the russet throw carpet between the beds. I jumped up and ran to the bathroom where I yanked several yards of toilet paper from the roller. Then I hurried back and pounced on the wet patch, sponging up as much alcohol as possible."I tormented her about 'the warlord'," lamented father, "but she knows and I know that her father wasn't a warlord; he was a general.  A great marshal! To think how much we owe him for how he raised your mother. Helped her become the person she became. What did anybody in my family ever do for us?"He leaned over and clutched my collar, causing me to gag slightly. He whispered, "Sometimes at night ...""Yes?" I asked, tugging at my lapel while using a shirt sleeve to wipe a few drops of liquor from the floorboards around the carpet's edge."My seventeen students," he continued, "they come to me. They stand and watch me. They don't say anything, but I understand what they want. You see, they blame me, accuse me.""Of what?" I said, getting back up to my feet and pulling myself free of Father's grasp.  I put the wad of half-soaked toilet paper on the night stand and debated taking some wet paper towels to the carpet. "When your mother became sick," said Father not answering my question, "I wondered to myself what if I had wronged her too. What if I had brought her to this. What if one day she were to ... to ...to come to me in my sleep, to haunt me.... I couldn't bear it. I could not bear it!"I sat down next to Father. "Ba," I said putting a hand on his back, which heaved with every breath. Tears wetted his great white beard. Possibly he deserved haunting, but who was I to say? He was so much the frightened child, so helpless and contrite. "Shouldn't we," I tentatively suggested, "call Jennifer?"Father lifted his head. "Is it after eleven yet?" he asked inexplicably switching to English. "Not quite eleven," I answered in kind, a little taken aback that my ploy to distract him had seemly worked so well."How much more time?" he pursued."Oh, not much," I insisted."How much?""Well, um, about an hour?""An hour!" he exclaimed in English. "It's still day rate!""No, actually not. It's early evening rate.""But there's still a cheaper late rate, right?""Yeah," I said, "but it won't make that much difference, especially for a short call." "Every penny, boy. Your mother taught us to save every penny."Mother was indeed frugal, but tightfistedness was a lesson Father had written."But Ba," I protested, "if we don't call Jennifer to tell her Ma's alright, then she might get nervous and book a flight out here! Plane tickets without advanced booking are exorbitantly expensive!" "Really?" said Father retreating into Mandarin. "Do you suppose she'd do that?" He rolled his eyes, raised a hand and began waving his finger back and forth as though keeping time to a tune in his head. Undoubtedly, he was trying to tally airline charges. I must confess that my sister's plight didn't really worry me much. Of course, I wanted Jennifer to know the day's fine outcome, but when we'd originally notified her of this latest operation, its portent and urgency had been dramatically downplayed."Do you really suppose she'd do that?" repeated Father. "Weeeell," I drawled, "if you keep her hanging in the air too long.... You know how nervous she can get."Smiling mischievously, he squinted his eyes and wrinkled his nose. "Remember the time," he said, "when she threw a pair of scissors at your face? You taunted her, and she couldn't bear it. She's high-strung alright. You were five and she was eight." He grabbed his empty glass and quickly refilled it. "We'll give her a call as soon as we finish this one last drink.""Okay," I said."A toast to your sister!"This time we clinked glasses in the Western fashion but once again drained them Eastern style.Two Skies     v for the both of thema wha.

7#$8BDWDWaaaacccc"c"ccdgxad di+*iUai+ei+i+~,i+i+i+i+i+i+Chapter 12: Hat-topped Mountain"In the glare and heat of mid-afternoon," began Father pouring out fresh drinks, "the cave was dark and cool.""What is this the story of?" I asked, pushing aside the whiskey bottle. I reached across my bed and pulled a navy blue vinyl duffel bag towards me, groping inside for the portable cassette player. As I hastily prepared the machine for recording, Father's whole body started to rock. "The table and chairs," he resumed with an impish smile, "were set close to the cave's entrance such that sunlight was sufficient for Mistress Wu's needle work.""Wait a minute," I interrupted. "I thought you lived with Man-niang at Ai-wu's estate. What's this about a cave? Who's 'Mistress Wu'? This woman is sewing  inside a cave?"Father's grin broadened; his eyes rolled. "Mistress Wu was middle-aged and robustly built. The torn trousers she mended belonged to her son. The little girl sitting beside her was her granddaughter. The two small boys seated across the table were myself and my little brother.""Little brother?" I said."'So Ming-xu,' said Mistress Wu without looking up from her work.  'What do you and your little gang have planned for today?'"My little brother looked to me, and I shook my head as though tacitly commanding him not to divulge classified information. "'Nothing,' said Ming-xu to our temporary guardian."Mistress Wu smiled as she looked up briefly from her work.  Ming-xu with his fine complexion, delicate features and big eyes probably struck her as an unusually handsome little boy. By contrast, I must have seemed remarkably unexceptional. Although my face was neither fat nor thin, it was awkwardly large for my small frame. My eyes were dull.  No wonder uncle had gotten rid of his surrogate son, and my father didn't want me back either."'The village men,' informed Mistress Wu, 'have planned a fishing trip. Why, they're probably down at the river right now.' She sighed and returned to her sewing. 'In a while you three little ones can go have a look, but right now it's still too hot.'"All three of us were dressed in loose, comfortable cotton shirts and trousers dyed in shades of gray and blue. We wore straw sandals, just as did Mistress Wu. But for the scissors, odd-shaped scraps of cloth and sewing paraphernalia the table was bare. Behind us was the household proper."As the cave was not natural but rather dug out of a cliff face, its shape was quite regular--a long box with smooth, flat walls and a curved ceiling.  Against one wall was the 'kang'--an expansively wide bed big enough to accommodate the whole family and with an oven built into its base for heat in winter.  Next to the kang were several large wooden trunks.  Against the opposite wall was a low, wooden table with two chairs set to either side."Stealing a peek at the little girl, I found myself being studied. Though the intensity of her stare positively alarmed me, I managed to hold her gaze for a long moment before shying away.  The darkness of her eyes, the curve of her face, the pout of her lips: bewitching. "Squirming in her seat, the little girl bumped Mistress Wu, who looked down on her granddaughter and noticed her staring across the table. She followed the line of the little girl's sight to Ming-xu and smiled at the prospect of a possible match. I doubt though that she would have smiled had she any inkling of our father's financial status. He was a ruined man who could never hope to raise the bride price for such a precious girl. On the other hand, Mistress Wu's son had lost big to our father in mahjong, which was why he had agreed to take my brother and me for the summer. If Mistress Wu's son continued to gamble with Father and lose, then who could say about the girl?  "'Have you explored the spring at the base of the mountain yet?' asked Mistress Wu cheerfully."I nodded while Ming-xu shook his head.  "'Yes?' said Mistress Wu 'No? Which is it?' She considered Ming-xu from out of the corners of her eyes. 'When were you and your brother apart?'"Ming-xu shrugged his shoulders."'Well,' she said, 'it really wouldn't do for either you or your brave brother to explore the springs alone, especially at night.' She abruptly stopped working to look at us in earnest. 'We believe that the dragon of the spring is friendly, but I wouldn't bet my life on it.'"'Dragon?' said Ming-xu. He looked to me, but I made no sign."'The dragon has two round eyes as big as my hands,' elaborated Mistress Wu holding up her fists. 'Children see them glowing in the night, sometimes just beneath the water's surface, sometimes peering out from the spring's cave.' "Ming-xu looked to me again. 'Have you seen the eyes?' he asked timidly."I didn't answer."Mistress Wu looked over suspiciously. 'Have you?' she said.  "For a long moment I sat perfectly still, keeping my eyes trained on the black-and-white newsprint poster pasted on the opposite wall--Yue Fei, the Sung Dynasty general who had kept the nomad hordes at bay.  From the back of his coal-black stallion, the great champion brandished a red-tasseled, wrought-iron lance. Finally, I turned to our guardian and said, 'Of course I've seen the eyes.'"Mistress Wu's pupils dilated. She blinked several times. 'You are brave,' she said. 'But don't be foolish! Sometimes courage is the twin of stupidity!' She tried to return her attention to sewing and had trouble picking up the stitch again.  Accidentally jabbing her finger with the needle, she yelped in pain. She put her work down and shut her eyes for some moments. When she opened them again, her expression conveyed an icy self-possession."'There are spirits here,' she cautioned, 'just as there are spirits everywhere, and offending one is to nobody's benefit. They feed on confusion and fear, just as the wild dogs feed on carrion. As bold as you are, if something unexpected happened, your metal would melt sure enough! What if the dragon spirit ...' She stopped momentarily but then quickly resumed with a cross look on her face. 'What if Lord Dragon suddenly materialized out of the night air?' "'Lord?' I asked. 'Lady,' I corrected her."The good woman's jaw dropped. I darted a look at the little girl, whose mesmerizing eyes were riveted on me."'You had better take care,' said Mistress Wu in fresh agitation as she tried to refocus her frayed attention upon needlework.  'It doesn't do well to tempt a dragon spirit. Plenty of grown men, let alone careless little boys, have been led to their demise by no more than fox fairies. Think of that!'"I was beginning to regret my ruse. The truth was that the executed convict still hung before my mind's eye, so during the two weeks that I and my brother had lived in the mountain village, I had not once wandered alone in the evening or led Ming-xu beyond the last cave dwelling."'Three years ago,' said Mistress Wu, 'a fox fairy in the form of a young maiden seduced the blacksmith Zhang. He fell head over heels for her, and she convinced him that she was just as madly in love. Well, old Mr. Zhang was a married man with two children, a pair of boys not unlike the two of you.... "I'll marry you," the fox fairy told him, "but not before you prove your love." The blacksmith must have said, "Just tell me how," and the fox fairy answered, "By leaving your wife and burying your children!"' "'Did he really?' asked Ming-xu horrified. "Mistress Wu smiled and wagged a finger. 'That old Zhang wasn't a complete fool. He dug a hole alright and put his two little boys in it, but he also put a roof over their heads and fitted it with a couple of air pipes. So when he covered the cellar with dirt, it was only a matter of time before the children's cries caught somebody's attention, and they were rescued.' "'And what of Mr. Zhang?' I asked."'Ah,' said Mistress Wu. 'Now there was justice.' She looked from me to my little brother to her pretty granddaughter.  'He went out into the forest to the place where they were supposed to rendezvous. But the fox fairy never showed. Two hefty bandits came around in her stead. They took all of Zhang's money and broke his legs for their trouble. And that is why our village blacksmith walks with a limp. The clever fox fairy must have squeezed a good long laugh out of that one.'"The little girl giggled with glee; Ming-xu laughed and clapped his hands."After half an hour more, Mistress Wu decided the sun had set low enough in the sky to permit an expedition down to the river, so she dismissed us. We each thanked her in turn for an excellent story and then hurried out the entrance, leaving small puffs of dust lingering in the air. "We raced along the zig zag path down Hat-topped Mountain, pausing ever so often to catch our breaths or greet a village aunt or uncle. The air was still heavy, and by the time we reached the river bank, we were panting hard and drenched with sweat. I was sorry for the blacksmith's two boys, but I couldn't help feeling glad for my brother and me. We were so lucky that our family didn't want us anymore. Would that they never took us back."'Ho!' came the distant cry of one of the village men. We pushed through the ferns and small brush to the embankment."The sky was milky blue. The sun swam above the tree tops.  A cloud of gnats settled down upon us. The little girl began to complain and spit, so I took her by the hand and led her upstream and out of the gnat fog.  Ming-xu followed close behind.  "We soon caught sight of one of the village men. Even from a distance, his sweat-covered body glistened in the sun. We couldn't see his face though, for it was obscured by a broad-rimmed bamboo hat. We no longer raced but walked at a leisurely pace.  As we drew near the fishermen, their wide net hit the river's surface, and a circle of pearly drops leapt into the air." By the time Father brought his latest installment to a sleepy conclusion, it was fast approaching eleven o'clock.  The bottle had long since been finished.  Father could barely keep his eyes open, but he prepared to tramp back downstairs to make the promised call to Jennifer until I prevailed upon him to go to bed. I would make the call for the both of us.I helped him undress down to his T-shirt and shorts and was distressed to find them soiled from weeks of continuous wear."What do you suppose Mother would say if she knew your underclothing were so dirty?""Oh, I'm sorry," moaned Father, "I'm sorry. I'll change tomorrow.  First thing tomorrow." Smiling, the troglodyte climbed into bed. Although it was already early May, the nights were still cool, so I tucked in his covers, silently scolding myself for my negligence. Turning out the lights, I went to my own bed and sat down on the edge, fighting desperately against the urge to lie down and sleep. When I could no longer hear Father stir, I quietly got up again and left the room. I made my way downstairs, concentrating very hard on walking so as not to trip or bang the banister.Arriving at the family room, I found the MacLaughlins watching Johnny Carson. Bathed in the light of the "Tonight Show" they conjured images of lunar moths changed into human form but retaining a faint trace of the moon's luminescence."Is your father asleep?" asked Mrs. MacLaughlin."Yes," I answered.The tops of the sofas were draped with delicate pieces of old lace, which my liquor-soaked mind speculated were woven from floss secreted out of pores hidden beneath their clothes. "It's been a big day," noted Mr. MacLaughlin beaming."Yes, it has," I agreed, feeling guilty for my thoughts."Is he warm enough with the blankets he has?" asked Mrs. MacLaughlin."I think so."The young mother smiled, and despite myself, I was sorely tempted to ask her whether others of her species spoke English."Um," I said assuming an apologetic tone and opening my mouth as little as possible for fear of exposing my scorpion breath. "May I use the telephone for one long distance call? Collect?" How stupid not to have drunk a gallon of water before coming downstairs."Of course," sang Mr. MacLaughlin. "You sure can use our phone, but not if you're going to call collect. That's too expensive. Dial direct.""Oh no," I said, half-expecting his bushy eyebrows to crawl away like caterpillars. "I can't do that." I pressed my fingers into my own brows to keep them pinned down. The blunt pain behind my eyes was mounting."Sure you can!" encouraged Mr. MacLaughlin."Why, that's decent of you," I heard myself say. "But only if you promise to let me know the charge once you get a phone bill.""Well," replied my host, "after what those doctors did for me, I kind of like sharing in these ... good news occasions with other people."As a wild young larva, MacLaughlin had had a piece of himself knocked off in a motorcycle accident, and the doctors at the Hannover Center had reconnected his leg. Although sensation had never returned below the knee, his soul had been transformed by gratitude. He was a butterfly disguised as a beetle. "Thank you," I heard my spider voice utter. I finally took up the receiver, and just as I began to dial, I felt a light tap on my shoulder. Expecting to see the kind MacLaughlin, I was dumbfounded to find the troglodyte instead, wearing nothing but his soiled T-shirt and shorts."Have you reached Ping Ping yet?" he asked pointing to the receiver."No," I gasped."Come on, come on, come on," he said with glee. "Let me!" "Quit grabbing."I didn't dare look directly at the MacLaughlins, who were just at the fringe of my field of vision."Hold it," I said."Hold what?" asked Father."I haven't finished dialing yet!" I cried, fending him off with an out-stretched arm."Boy?" he said. "What have you been doing all this time down here? Eating chicken?" He laughed. "Eating too much chicken?!""Hello?" I heard my sister say, and I relinquished the phone to Father."Jie Jie," he said softly using the endearment form for 'Big Sister', and he proceeded to deliver a detailed account of the day.  I deeply regretted not having made him molt his dirty underwear and put on the fresh clean pajamas Mother had packed for him weeks earlier.

7#$;`w@FWFWPPPPtQQQQQQQRzxQ<|R SW>*WhPW>S(W>W>`K,W>W>W>W>W>W>Chapter 13: The VentilatorFather leaned close to Mother and whispered, "Guang Guang's got his Ph.D."Mother acknowledged with a slight movement of her head.Since the emergency surgery, her body had continued to swell so that her skin now looked alarmingly tight.  Even the whites of her eyes, now yellowed, had swollen. Her pupils had become recessed black patches. Like round little peat bogs in shallow hollows."Guang Guang's a doctor now," whispered Father.  "He's going to be alright."A blue plastic tube an inch in diameter ran from Mother's mouth to a devise the size of a small washing machine.Father patted Mother's hand. She knit her brows and nodded as a single bead of sweat slid across her forehead. Father caught it with a gentle application of his shirt sleeve. I understood that the blue plastic tube extended down into my mother's lungs, and the washer-sized machine pumped air into them. For reasons unknown, her lungs had stiffened to the extent that she could not breathe on her own."Ba," I said, and Father looked up. "Don't ask Ma any questions or say anything she'll need to make a reply to. It's hard for her to answer."Father raised his brows. "Yes, yes!" he said.  "You're quite right! Quite right!"As loud as the machine's breathing was, I could barely see the rise and fall of Mother's chest. I wondered if she was getting enough oxygen. I looked to surgeon Belamy flanked by Dr. Bravo and resident Wong.  The three of them were in conference while several lesser residents, interns and nurses looked on. For five days now the machine had breathed for Mother. The new condition, which was called Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome, had developed the night of our victory celebration.Father continued to lean close to Mother though he remained quiet. I wondered if Mother could feel her hand in his. Father looked very pale as he too had lost the ability to sleep.  I looked out the large windows at the field beyond the hospital parking lot. Its black earth was marked by scattered blades of long grass. I turned back to Father. His cotton flannel shirt looked soft and warm. Though I was a little too far from him to smell the fabric, I caught its familiar scent in my mind.Mother's hands began to move, to pat her lap."What does she want?" asked Father looking first to me and then the doctors.Dr. Belamy glanced curiously at his patient.Mother's face turned red. She used the fingers of her right hand to feel the fingers of her left. She opened her eyes wide and pinched the stem of her left ring finger and then pulled up on her finger several times in succession.  The sweat stood out on her forehead as she raised her right hand, balled it into a fist and, after a few seconds, let it drop back down to her lap. With even greater apparent effort, she repeated this gesture."Her wedding ring!" I cried. "She wants her wedding ring!""Yes, of course!" said Father. "Her wedding ring! Where is it?"I quickly fished a small, blue silk purse out of my pants pocket. Loosening the draw string, I held the purse upside-down.  With a little shake, Mother's gold wedding band and violet amethyst engagement ring tumbled into my hand. I passed them to Father, who hurriedly pressed them into Mother's palm."Here they are," he said. "Here are your rings." Mother nodded. Father shut tight his eyes and shook his head.  She put the rings on her finger, first the gold band and then the amethyst ring. As they wouldn't go even as far as the second joint she started pushing on them with what strength she could summon.I moved in beside Father, close to Mother's head, and began to stroke her hair."That's alright, Ma," I said. "You've got them on now. You've got them on, and they won't fall off."She relinquished her struggle, and the flush quickly drained from her face. Her eyelids shut as far as they could, leaving a slender watery crescent exposed beneath the lashes. Her hands slipped to her sides.  Father covered his face, and I looked to the electronic monitors to check that she still showed vital signs. The doctors returned to their conference."Ba," I said, "she's asleep.""Yes," said Father, "That's good. She's getting some rest. She needs the rest." He held onto her hand as he pinched the bridge of his nose. With the other hand, he wiped his eyes.I quietly moved to Mother's side and slipped the rings off her finger. "The rings will constrict her fingers if they continue to swell," I explained to Father. He nodded."Do you want to hold onto them?" I asked."No," he answered. "It's better if you do."I put the rings back into the silk purse, pulled the draw string tight and stuffed the purse deep into my pants pocket. "Do you want to come out for a cup of coffee?" I asked. He shook his head.Now that Mother had put her rings on once, I did not think she would check to see if they were still there. Because of my fear that the rings might slide off and be lost or would have to be cut off if she died wearing them, I left her only with the illusion that they were still there. I realized that what I had done was possibly wrong, that I had acted out of a type of greed, the greed for mother's rings, but not as rings per se, not as mere jewelry, rather as momentos of her, my mother. What was more important? Her wearing her rings to the end or my having unscathed momentos? I fled the room in an attempt to escape my shame. I was almost to the elevator when Dr. Belamy and his entourage caught me up. "Mr. Zhou," he said."Oh yes," I said turning around, caught off guard. "I almost forgot, but do you suppose she may need a little more oxygen.  Her chest doesn't move much. Perhaps I'm being naive""Her oxygen intake is fine," said Dr. Wong with furrowed brows.I looked to Dr. Belamy. He nodded confirmation."Okay," I said.He stepped closer to me while his two lieutenants and several underlings stood motionless behind him. He said, "There's something else we need to talk to you about."I waited."Has Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome been explained to you?" he asked."Yes," I lied. Dr. Bravo and Dr. Wong had provided but the briefest, vaguest of explanations. The few details that I possessed had been gathered from conversations with our family doctor and my sister the nurse in training. "Generally," he continued, "our patients with ARDS do not do very well.""What do you mean?" I asked, eyeing him suspiciously. When he hesitated to answer, I looked beyond him to Dr. Bravo and Dr. Wong. "What do you mean?" I repeated though I understood the implication perfectly."I mean," said Dr. Belamy, "that they don't generally do very well. The recovery rate is quite small." He sighed. "Perhaps negligible. We will, of course, continue doing everything we can, but ... we must think about her suffering.""Yes," I said.He studied me, as though in doubt that I had understood the meaning of his words or perhaps even that I had heard what he'd said. He looked at me as, I imagine, he might look at a small tree or a wooden post. Something inanimate. Lifeless. "She's resting now because we've given her a massive dose of morphine. It's possible that things will begin to turn for the better, but when it comes to ARDS, miracles are extremely rare. Extremely rare." He paused briefly, to see if a response were forthcoming. Since one was not, he continued, "When this dosage of morphine losses effectiveness we won't be able to increase it again.... You can see how much pain she's in." He stopped once more, waiting for response. I glanced down at his shiny shoes. How fine they looked. How flawless the leather. "If things get much worse," said Dr. Belamy, "you and your family may need to consider ... letting her go." He wet his lips. He gently added, "Do you understand what I'm saying?"I looked into his eyes. I searched his eyes. I answered, "Yes." I said in a voice the hardness of which was something previously unknown to me, "I understand you, Doctor, and I appreciate your directness. I will talk all of this over with my father. But at this point in time, you are to understand me. You will continue to do everything you can to keep her alive."Dr. Belamy simply stood there, his arms hanging by his side. I knew he was waiting again, waiting for me to say something different, something more along his lines, something merciful perhaps. But as before, nothing of the sort was forthcoming. After some time, he finally conceded, "Of course," with a gracious smile and a nod. "Everything in our power."I thanked him for his help. The elevator door slid open, right on cue. I stepped inside. I turned around to see Dr. Belamy leading his group away. The elevator door slid shut.The judge's face was black. Blood red streaks in the shape of elongated teardrops arched from the corners of his eyes towards the lobes of his ears. A small white moon dominated his forehead.  The judge's ankle-length robe was of flowing silk, ocean blue with a bottom trim of rippling orange waves. As he high-stepped out from behind his tall desk, his platform wooden shoes clapped loudly against the floorboards of the stage."I am the justice of the dead," he sang in a booming voice. "The verdict is guilt and the sentence life."The general, dressed in leopard-skins and gleaming fish-scale armor, slowly dropped to his knees. The red tassels of his warrior's headdress quivered in the air. He rested a hand on the hilt of his sword. For his worldly imperfections, for his flaws as a human being during the life just expired, for his wrongful acts and his crimes of omission, he was condemned to yet another incarnation."What will the general return as," sang the black-faced judge.  "A mule for the spur or a sow for the cleaver?""Do you think he'll use his sword?" asked Ming-xu anxiously, his eyes riveted to the actors on stage. "No," I said. "The general's a coward at heart. You saw how he died."Just at that moment, guards with great halberds appeared at the either end of the stage."If the general draws his blade so much as an inch," I said, "the hounds will fall on him. They'll cut him to pieces. There is pain, even after death. Only the innocent and fearless may preserve their wholeness and reside in the sky." The theatre was packed, for it was the first afternoon of Spring Festival. Not only were all booths and benches occupied, but the side aisles and rear space were also crowded to capacity with the standing audience. Having squeezed out an exclusive booth between the legs of standers, my brother and I knelt at the head of one of the side aisles, affording us a view somewhat skewed but still perfectly acceptable. Ming-xu suddenly turned to me. He said, "Are you hungry yet?"Startled that my brother's absorption in the drama could be upstaged, I studied him. "Are you?" I asked.Ming-xu nodded."Well then," I said, "what are you going to do about it?" I looked back to the judge.The sound of people cracking melon seeds and spitting out the shells was suddenly drowned out by the blasting chorus of three-stringed violins and reed pipes, long bamboo flutes and pear-shaped wooden lutes, steel gongs and steel cymbals.  Ming-xu sighed and turned his attention back to the stage.A little more than an hour later, the theatre doors opened. The audience poured out into the streets like a flood surge, carrying with it two dirty, ragged little barefoot boys. It didn't take long though for the human tide to subside. Then my brother and I easily picked a path through the dispersing crowd to a narrow alley. We followed this dark passage to its other end and emerged on a wide street, the muddy drabness of which was only slightly alleviated by the colorful New Year's lanterns hanging above every door and shop front.I inspected each lantern as we walked beneath it and called out the dramatic scenes depicted. After Ming-xu corrected me on one, I stopped talking out loud and identified the scenes only to myself.The air was cool and moist. The ground below was wet and cool against the soles of our feet. The sky above was a solid sheet of gray. Off to our left were two hills the shape of inverted teacups. As they slowly passed, I gazed at their trees, sparse but green.  We walked by a large man squatting next to a rain-stained wall with his trousers gathered around his ankles, unabashedly relieving himself.  The offensive steam of his feces rising like a thin morning mist. What a crime against nature."Are we going to eat now?" asked Ming-xu as he trotted along, doing his best to keep up with me."Yes," I answered."Was the banquet Mother prepared for us as well?" "What do you think?""But ... but," he stammered, "it's Spring Festival!"I smirked at the notion. "It's Spring Festival," I corrected him, "for Father and his gambling pals." "We'll get some of it," insisted Ming-xu, narrowing his eyes as though squinting at something in the distance. "We're sure to get some, provided we don't get there too late.""You could have left the threatre any time you wanted," I shouted. "I wasn't the one holding you back. You were the one holding you back. And if you somehow insist upon laying the blame on me, then you're welcome to stay home next time there's a show. I'll go by myself.""I know I could have left," said Ming-xu defiantly. "But ... but ... " Unable to find a rejoinder, he lapsed back into a sullen and peevish silence.  Save for the fruit we managed to steal from street vendors and the table scraps we scavenged at restaurants, there were now times when we went without a regular meal for two or three days running. It wasn't that our mother forgot.  Indeed, she never failed to save for us portions of the large meals prepared for Father and his ravenous friends.  But we tended to stay away from the house so long that by the time we returned at nights, Father and his friends had usually gobbled up the leftovers as snacks.I steered a labyrinthine course through the city streets. Ming-xu muttered miserably to himself about the unnecessarily long route home. When the lenght of the detour became for unbearable, he finally complained, "My feet and ankles are covered with mud." "The mud will dry within an hour after we get home," I told him. "Then you can scrape it off."Soon we stopped before a brick doorway marked by a lantern whose painted scene had long since faded beyond recognition. I turned to my brother and looked him over. I began to slap his arms and shoulders, the blows producing tiny clouds of dust. "What are you're doing?" he asked sharply."Shut up," I said.I slapped his back, butt and thighs before repeating the procedure for myself. Ming-xu helped by pounding my back and shoulders up as far as he could reach. "Alright," I said, and he stopped. I opened the door and held it for my brother.  As we stepped across the threshold, we were greeted by the howling of our new sister and the drunken laughter of our hyena father and his wild dog friends. Two Skies     v from my pants pocket,.

7#$/@Z.6W6W6W6W6W6ef9999999:3x6: :?*?+'6W?: ??@R??????Chapter 14: Intensive Care"At some point her heart will no longer be able to stand the strain," said Dr. Jacobson emphatically. "And it will stop."Dr. Jacobson was a balloon of a man with a pitted, sallow face. He sat across a large rectangular oak table from me and my sister Jennifer, who had caught a flight out from San Francisco just the evening before. Dr. Belamy sat in the chair next to his colleague. Behind the two men the conference room wall was painted a mute shade of green with paper ceiling trim showing a running, wavy vine that was speckled with tiny blossoms but for some reason made me think of barbed wire. All around us on the walls hung oil portraits of the hospital's notable physicians."There is," I noted, "still a chance."Dr. Jacobson cleared his throat.  "A fraction of a fraction of a chance."I looked to my sister Jennifer.  Her face seemed slightly swollen as well. I didn't know whether she had gained weight during my long absence in Australia or if it had something to do with the shock of seeing Mother in her present condition.  "Jie," I said, "What do you think?""I don't know," she answered, almost in a whisper."They can't understand what we're saying," I reminded her since we were speaking in Mandarin."I know," she said blinking her bleary eyes, pink from lack of sleep. "But maybe we shouldn't talk about it right now anyways."Dr. Belamy looked attentive but detached. Dr. Jacobson's face was full of expectation. The man obviously wanted a decision.  It was also apparent to me that my sister was not at the moment competent to form an informed opinion. So I turned back to the two doctors, and I said, "At this point if her heart should stop, resuscitation procedures are to be implemented.""You understand the odds?" challenged Dr. Jacobson brusquely."You just explained them.""Yes, but do you understand?""Whatever the odds," I said, "if there's still a chance, there's still a chance. No one can predict the future. No one can say with one hundred percent certainty what will occur in the next minute or even second. There are a lot of things that happen that simply can not be explained. That are beyond scientific knowledge. Even medical knowledge."Dr. Jacobson put both hands on the polished, gleaming table and hunched forward like a lion preparing to pounce. He growled, "I've spent a life time studying ARDS." "Yes," I acknowledged, wanting to add something like, "so I gathered," but unable to lend voice to such an utterance for fear of further provoking the beast in the man.He shook his head like a wild boar being bothered by relentless flies. He fairly snorted, "After my father died of this disease. I devoted my life to it.""Yes," I said, feeling suddenly ashamed of harboring such unflattering thoughts. Afterall, Dr. Jacobson was more than a mere surgeon; he was an ordinary person too, a son like myself.Dr. Belamy covered his mouth with a fist and coughed lightly. "Dr. Jacobson," he remarked in his usual measured tone, "is a recognized world authority on ARDS.""As you explained," I said."And what choice does your mother have in all of this?" asked Dr. Jacobson. "It is she, not you, who suffers. It is she, not you, who endures. Does she want to keep on living? When every minute and even second as you say is excruciatingly painful beyond comprehension? Or is it you who impose this 'wish' on her? You are condemning your mother to a hellish existence."Dr. Belamy coughed loudly into his hand. Just enough of a signal. Dr. Jacobson stopped talking. The big man folded together his hands and sat back in his chair, staring at me all the while. My sister and I looked to one another."What should we do?" she asked.For all his cruel honesty, Dr. Jacobson might be right, and I both despised him and sympathized for his own tragic past. What a tiny, minute universe was mine that the life of one woman, hanging by a thread, artificially sustained by a ventilator, could crowd out the planets and their moons, the galaxies and their stars, filling every bit of space, pushing against its boundaries. The painted eyes of the suspended faces around us belonged to the larger universe of indifference.  I looked down at my own hands. I said to my sister, "I guess we have to ask her." Intensive Care was a long ward. Regularly-spaced enclaves housed patients' beds nestled in coves of life-support equipment large and small.  Oxygen tanks stood at the ready. Just beyond the machinery hung white plastic curtains to provide a fragile privacy when drawn around the closed loops of ceiling tracks.The IC nurses and attendants were distinguished from personel elsewhere in the hospital by their light blue trousers and white tunics. They moved to a quicker beat than that of their counterparts except perhaps in the emergency room. An extended white desk in the middle of the room served as IC's command post.  Here doctors and nurses sat on elevated cushioned chairs and logged their activities and wrote diagnoses into medical ledgers beneath the glow of small fluorescent lamps.Behind the desk ran a series of picture windows that looked out onto the road leading up to the emergency room bay.  At either end of the room were isolation quarters, which were sealed off from the primary ward's ceaseless bustle by heavy doors. Mother lay on a bed in the western isolation cell.It was now nine days since the emergency surgery. Mother's body was so swollen that I worried the skin might split. Her body was uniformly jaundiced a pale yellow except for the face, which was red. Her swollen yellow eyes with their sunken, black pupils bugged out and were never more than half shut.Father seemed in perpetual motion. If he wasn't pacing the floor, he was rocking his knees and rubbing his hands while he sat. His eyes were red because he cried often, usually quietly and to himself. Half an hour had yet to pass since the conference with Dr. Belamy and Dr. Jacobson. Father and I stood beside Mother's bed. It struck me that we were a little like a couple of men on a railway platform, afraid to move forward, afraid to get too close to the tracks. Waiting for the arrival of the train that would take us far, far away. Dr. Bravo stood at a respectful distance behind us."Mother," I said in a clear loud voice, "I have to talk with you about something. Can you hear me?"The linen sheets of her bed were disheveled as usual since she pushed them off whenever a nurse covered her. It amazed me that she still had the strength to do so. The tortured woman moved her head an inch towards her chest, which I understood to be a nod."The doctors," I said in a normal voice, "say that your heart ... may stop."This comment drew no response. I glanced at Father, who wore a button-up woolen sweater over his flannel cotton shirt.  The chill of the room seemed to penetrate him. I too could never get warm here.Looking back at Mother, I summoned my courage and forced myself to say in a loud voice, "If your heart stops ... do you want them to start it again."She nodded almost before I had finished speaking.  Her body began to tremble. I looked to Father. I said, "Does she understand?"He swallowed hard and shook his head. He whispered, "I don't know."The low roar of the breathing machine forcing oxygen into her resistant lungs was maddening. Despite an intravenous line that coursed morphine into her veins, her forehead was moist with the sweat of physical agony. Turning to her again, I said loudly, "Mama ... if your heart stops ... do you want us ... to let you die?"She shook her head. The quaking of her body intensified. I asked, "Do you want to live?"She nodded, her face drenched with sweat. I turned to Father and smiled.  He blinked and attempted a grin. I turned to Dr. Bravo and announced,  "There's your answer!" Dr. Bravo smiled shyly and looked down at the floor."Mama," said Father to Mother in a weak voice, "don't worry, we won't let you die."She made no visible response. Her body shook terribly."Mama," I said loudly. "Don't worry. We won't let you die. We won't. We won't let you die."She nodded, and slowly, her trembling subsided.Father walked to Mother's side, bent over and kissed her on the forehead. "We'll take good care of you," he said. "We'll never let you go." Mother didn't move. I made a wish that she had felt the kiss. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Bravo left the room.Through the isolation quarter's picture windows I watched an orange and white medical rescue van drive up to the emergency room bay, the red lights on top flashing but its siren silent. What were the chances for the patient inside? Better or worse than my mother's? Beyond the road stretched another muddy field, another leaden sky.  Father balled his right hand into a fist and began beating his left palm. "Ba," I said to Father. "Maybe you should go out and find Jennifer."He dropped his arms. "Jennifer?... Yes. I'll go find her. She's in the cafetaria, right? She's waiting for one of us. Yes, I'll go to tell her." As he started uncertainly for the door, he turned and said, "We didn't prepare your sister very well, did we?"I nodded in Mother's direction and put a finger to my lips. She so desperately needed her sleep."Oh," said Father, and he quietly exited.Once I was alone, I slumped to my knees and burst into tears. But I tried to stifle the sound, to bite down on my lips and swallow the sobs. My muffled crying was so hard that I had trouble breathing and had to gasp several times for air. I wanted to wrap my arms around my mother, to clutch her tight, to hold her and never let go, but I resisted, grabbing hold instead of the sheets to either side of her tortured body, making sure that I didn't bring to bear upon her the slightest pressure. I told her in as soft a voice as I could how much I loved her, how much I needed her, how much a little boy still lived to feel her fingers brushing through his hair, how much a little boy still dreamt of his mother holding his hands in her's as she guided waxy colored crayons across the perfect white of sheets of precious smuggled typing paper. I reminded her of how she used to pick me up when my spirits were down. How she used to try to play ball with me, never mind the long restrictive dresses. How she always had snacks ready and waiting for me after school, stored on the oven racks, bags of my favorite chips and cookies. I recounted how she used to carry my heavy saxophone to school on music lesson days since I was too little to do it for myself. And after school, there she would be, waiting on the sidewalk, a block away from the school so as to minimize my embarrassment before my classmates. My mother. The giant of my small life. How was it that I could not now be a giant for her? How was it that I could not be a healer? How was it that I could not bend down and pluck out of her body the illness that was doing this to her, remove it from her tenuous life, catch it by the tail like a troublesome little mouse and fling it into the sky, piercing the clouds, far beyond the gravity of this life, into the fiery sun? How was it that miracles were beyond my power? How was it that I was still nothing more than a mortal little boy? How was it that this boy had nothing for his mother but awful questions, repugnant questions, questions that I hated to have asked, questions that I detested to have passed my lips, questions that compounded her misery a hundred, a thousand fold? How was it that I was less than helpful? Worse than useless? How was it? How was it? How was it?...Fifteen minutes later when a nurse entered the room I was dry-eyed and sitting in a chair with my hands neatly folded on my lap.Two Skies     v,,, for his colleague to catch his drift, sound-proofquiet of the ... , threatening perhaps the intravenous lines inserted into her arms and the plastic tube running down her throat triumphantlyits<wchar_t>>>"bx!"V"b!c"c!R\ux8;[^  .//////////@/M/N/[/_////@P@& !E:_s$@_cb!S{LR4yEg pP ! pP !  pP !  pP !  pP !7 T  !!"##$%W%.x.///////N//,Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C/p$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@ pP !.@/[#-S.mno/pDq@rPs !E:_s$@_cb!x2[U@BYv;  J  !f!#l#$%%@.6.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$//U/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH(FG(HH(d'h=/BmH-: HP DeskJetFNew YorkGenevaMonacoPalatinoTimesHelveticaCourierSymbolMishawakaMishawaka BoldUTrebuchet MSArialCharcoalCapitalsSandCourier NewTechnoMonotype SortsTimes New RomanWingdingsHoefler TextHoefler Text OrnamentsImpactSkiaTextileGadgetApple ChanceryMT ExtraComic Sans MS/BrushScrDKBalloonDExtBoliCooperBlaDDomCasualDRegParkAveDAndale Mono#VerdanaBernhardFasDURWImperialTRegEurostileTBlaExtURWBodoniTReg MicrogrammaDMedExt CNevisonCasD ENicolasCocTReg OkayD OldEnglishD!PlaybillD!SpringfieldD"VAGRundschriftD"WindsorDReg$*BrodyJoiD$6HogarthScrJoiD$BVladimirScrJoiD%Missy BT%Liorah BT%Ryan BT%Hank BT%Melanie BT/-Arial Black/Georgia6ArabBruD7Webdings7BlacklightD9ChesterfieldAntD9GilliesAntDBol:DLegerD:eColumnaSolSCD:GoudySwaTLigIta:CoronetI?ChicagoVT100%%%EMBn1$6C7_l%.L.M.k.l.......//A/N/[/_/&/././././/

7#$#;."(( ( ( ( ( (.<(j(j(j(v((()x(j) )-*.[( -) --.i&------Chapter 15: Locked in a CageAs the afternoon slipped by in my mother's company, I knew I should entertain happy memories, savor every second, slip back to those times that were for us a blessing, but try as I might, I could not dislodge my thoughts from the most painful episodes of our lives together. I saw again the shadows of someone's shoes through the narrow space beneath our front door. I heard again the crazed high-pitched barking of our little terrier. There never came a knock on the door. There never came a grunt or a cough. There never came a reply to our frightened entreaties of "Who's there?".Some days upon coming home from school I found a strange boat of a car parked outside our house, its beefy crewcut driver avoiding my eyes, looking straight ahead at the road. The car sped away whenever Mother approached, and it followed slowly behind her like a huge stray mechanical pup when she walked down the street to the grocery store. Nothing at first ever happened when Father was around, so his doubts and snide dismissals simply doubled Mother's anxiety. Federal agents started questioning our friends. Anonymous phone calls taunted us with racist obscenities. It was the middle of the Cold War, and Father was publishing articles in Asia attacking the right-wing Nationalists of Taiwan, supporting the mainland Communists and, apparently, drawing both the rancor of right-wing groups here in the U.S. and the attention of the FBI. People entered our house while we were out walking the dog and rearranged the furniture to tell us they had been there and could come again, whenever they pleased, even as we slept. But of course, there was the dog.One rainy autumn evening I went to the door to call our little "Lucky" dog back from her late night rounds, but she didn't return. A few seconds later, I found her dead in front of our house with her skull cracked open. I hauled the limp and blood-soaked body back to the porch. The next day I buried my dog in the back yard. I whispered not a word to any of my friends. I lost interest in school and confided nothing to the one teacher who was astute enough and good enough to ask me what was wrong since my grades slumped. The evening calls began. Father, at last, knew that everything we claimed was true. On a winter's evening someone pelted our living room windows with snowballs, keeping up a steady barrage while a synchronized phone call informed us of a bomb, informed us that we were about to be blown to smithereens. Mother pleaded with Father to stop. What use articles of opposition against a regime floating in exile on an island on the opposite side of the globe? Why did a grown man spend so much time, money and effort on student rallies and marches? He had a family to raise. Did he want to jeopardize his retirement? Afterall, he worked for a research institute connected to the U.S. Navy. Did he want to ruin his children's futures? He knew how Americans viewed Chinese politics. The local police came promptly at our call and listened politely to Father's tirade against the Nationalists and the FBI. He lauded the Communists, who had reunited the country after a hundred years of war and made China strong again. Mother cringed. The officers in their black uniforms drank steaming cups of her jasmine tea and complimented its fragrance. They agreed that in this American community we should definitely, without question not be harassed. They agreed to tap our phone if that was what we wanted, and they promised to alert their patrol cars to be on the look out for suspicious vehicles and persons in the vicinity of this house. Father thanked them profusely and walked them to the door. Later that night Mother gathered Jennifer and me into her room. She had a cache of gold, she told us, given to her long ago by her father for just such an occasion as this when the need arose to flee with her children. We would buy airplane tickets to Taiwan; we would leave as soon as possible. The very next morning in fact! Then, suddenly, she burst into tears. And she cried and she cried and she cried, for where could a middle-aged woman really take her two half-grown American kids? To Taiwan, the land of her husband's bitter enemies? To mainland China, in the thralls of Cultural Revolution? Before the night was over, the right side of her face had swollen so badly that the eyelid was compressed shut, just as if someone had beaten her. There sat my poor mother at the edge of her bed, hunched over, her grotesque head supported by her hands, with barely the energy to stir. Many pearl white strands stood out in her thick hair on the right-hand half of her head, which before had been uniformly black. The phone calls stopped. The big car never again parked by our curb. But Father continued his political involvement, and the cold war between he and my mother escalated. I became a miniature Henry Kissinger, shuttling between the two sides with semi-classified information, struggling to maintain lines of communication, continually trying to broker a lasting truce. There was the occasional skirmish in front of embarrassed dinner guests and an ever-present threat of violenceMother swinging down at Father's skull with a frying pan only to find my raised fist, Mother holding a knife to the small of her throat and challenging Father to slit it. The troubles began during my first year of high school. Six years later in the summer after my graduation, Father went to mainland China. What he saw therethe extreme material deprivation, the socialist drabness of the cities, the absence of joy in the people, a whole nation handicapped and downtroddenfinally stanched the flow of angry words from his pen. He became politically inert. Gradually, the tension between he and Mother dissipated; harmony returned. Mother's hair became black again with hardly a trace of white or gray. But, of course, decades of hard labor and six interminable years of harassment and tension and terror might already have planted in her womb the fatal seed that would eventually produce those accursed grapes of cancer. What a strange fate had befallen my sweet mother on these alien shores. The civil war of her homeland had trailed her across an ocean. She, the general's daughter, had lived a peasant's life of endless, unappreciated toil as well as the fugitive's of fear and turmoil. Peace after so many years of war. She certainly deserved it, but did he? A few short years of peace for her and even love and affection, and now this?The brand of guilt plainly marked my father's face; now what his sentence? I looked at my mother, lying quivering on the hospital bed, bloated with pain. Was this how he would pay? Through her suffering and the "pain" it inflicted upon him? Not good enough. Not good enough! He deserved to be pelted with stones. He deserved to be beaten with staves. He deserved to be locked away, in solitary confinement, ten year for every year of her suffering. He deserved to be repudiated, to be cursed, to be shunned, to be isolated and forgotten, to be expunged from the hearts of his children, to be blotted from our minds, to be never talked to again, to be never even spoken of.At that instant, for some inexplicable reason, my revelry of rage and indictment gave way or broke but not like a reservoir dam under the pressures of the flood waters of an unabating storm. Rather, the great fury simply seemed to burst like a balloon to a pin prick, the pin prick of an unexpected recollection, the recollection of a secret confided to me one day by Jennifer's godmother over a snack of milk and cookies in the good woman's kitchen: When the Communists had captured Chengdu, its stubborn defender the 'Short General', marshal of western Sichuan, had been appointed city police chief but soon thereafter had disappeared. It was rumored that his enemies had taken him into the mountains and locked him away in a cage, where he had slowly expired of privation. I who had been entrusted with this information never uttered a word of it to Mother, and curiously, the present knowledge of it provided me a moment's respite. Grandfather had died a terrible death, one of defeat and humiliation, of exposure and hunger and parching thirst, but he now was free. Mother too would soon be free. And when father and daughter met again, were reunited, perhaps in the flowered courtyard of their beloved plantation estate, he in his creaseless military tunic and she in her long elegant silk dress, not a word would pass between them on what each had suffered. For to them, being together again, sitting side by side in the shade of a great parasol tree on a bright and sunny day would be all that mattered.Two Skies     veyes |*8|(T|THH|*8|t|28|0T|T@|u@8H80H8,@,A$8881N ,AN |!!P!"ACQT#"###5#6#9#:#;#@#E#F#G@P@"#8nm7 A#"###7#8#9#:#;#F#GR,Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C/p$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@ pP ! pP !  pP !  pP !

7#$RdQ\W\W\W\W\W\et\\\\\]]]x\^ ^)b_*b]\Wb_^? b_b_c,b_b_b_b_b_b_Chapter 1: RemembranceIt was now the middle of May, and the evening air was unquestionably warm. I sat at the base of one of the towering flag poles in front of the university's Graeco/Colonial administration mansion and contemplated the upwards-slanting shadows thrown by spotlights trained upon the mansion's massive stone columns. Beyond the bell tower shone the full moon, which was encircled by a faint halo. An indication of possible storms to come. But what did it matter?The quiet conversations of students passing by on the paved walkway less than fifty feet away lured my attention back to earth. I noticed a pretty young woman with long brown hair. She was slim; her features all correct, balanced, not anuglar or disproportioned in any way. A female companion said something that brought a smile to her face, and for a moment I imagined myself as a person who could bring a smile to the face of a perfectly beautiful young woman. The moist and heavy air seemed laden with romantic possibilities. But when the two coeds disappeared from sight, and I was left with only illusion again, my back braced against the hard cool metal flag pole, I got up to go.Along the avenue fronting the university, the shops and restaurants were all still open. The scent of romance was replaced by the smell of cheese steaks and fries, emanating from a restuarant called C.C. Peppers. My spirit thrived on the night life in the streets, so I was already beginning to miss a little the students when they would inevitably leave at the end of exams period. Not fifteen minutes later, I rounded the corner at O'Bannons Oriental Carpets Emporium and saw, like a travaller emerging from a woods, the lights shining in every window of my home. I proceeded down the sloping sidewalk of the hollow of our street. As I came to the two tall poplars standing silent sentinel before our front walkway, I heard Jennifer's hiccuping chuckle. Climbing the steps, I found her on the porch swing with Sara, one of the upstairs tenants. "Hi, Guang," said Jennifer frantically waving a hand and giving me a big grin. Some wine sloshed out of the glass in her other hand.  "Opps!""Jennifer," remonstrated Sara with furrowed brows and a diplomatic smile. She looked my way and said, "Hello David." "Hi," I replied.Sara was a roundish woman a little taller than Mother. She had a pretty face and kind eyes. During Mother's brief stay at the local hospital, Sara had brought flowers to decorate the room and, in the week since our return from Bitterfield, Sara had sat up almost every night with Jennifer as she drank herself into a giddy stupor. "How are you today?" asked Sara."Fine," I said.Jennifer cocked her head to one side and trumpeted, "Oh, David is fine. He's fine."I asked Sara, "How's your work going?""Good," she returned brightly.Jennifer raised her hands to her mouth and formed a wide funnel as though preparing to call to somebody at a distance. "Talking about work," she said, "isn't it about time you applied for some?" She chuckled at her own antic. I smiled. "Talking about jobs," she resumed in a more or less normal voice, "you remember Pastor Burman of the campus all-denomination fellowship?"I nodded."You remember Pastor Burman? Rupert Burman?" "Yes," I said."Oh," said Jennifer, grinning. "Sorry....Well, anyways," she started again, "you know how he doesn't really like counseling?" She waved her hands in the air in circles and then up and down, giving the impression of a drunken music conductor trying to lead his orchestra through a particularly tricky passage in the music.  "Which is strange for a pastor because things like relationship counseling is such a big part of their jobs these days. In fact, most modern pastors don't especially like writing sermons, but that's about all Burman does seem to enjoy." She shrugged her shoulders. "And even though pastor Burman doesn't really like a big part of his job, he sticks to it. And why? Because it's his job." She shook her head. "Why, even Claudia from the home for mentally retarded people? Even Claudia got stuck with a supermarket job bagging groceries that she doesn't like.  You wouldn't think that someone like Claudia could possibly not like any job, no matter how boring, but it happens, and she sticks to it." Sticking to it, sticking to it. What was big blister ranting about? The world of glue? My focus climbed the ropes of the swing until I noticed that they were terribly frayed around the steel rings by which they attached to ceiling hooks. Were the pieces of rope getting close to giving out? Would the swing come crashing down to the porch floor, jolting the bottoms of the swing sitters, sending shocks up their spinal columns, possibly cracking a disk or two? I looked back down, first at Sara and then at Jennifer."The U.N. in Africa," I said flatly. "has asked to see my resume.""Wow!" immediately exclaimed Sara, "Wow!"Jennifer shut her mouth. After a tense second or two, she managed to lift her brows.  "So when did this happen? Does Ba know?""He saw the letter when it arrived today.""It arrived today? You didn't show me? What did the letter say? What did Dad say?""As it turns out, the French professor I visited last year in Paris just became deputy director of the UN Environment Programme's desert development center in Nairobi.""Well that's nice," concluded Jennifer."Nice?" said Sara. "What a terrific coincidence. A U.N. job. In Africa. That's great. Congratulations. You must be sooo excited. Oh, but am I letting myself get ahead of things? Does this mean that you're probably going to get an offer or definitely going to get an offer?""Actually," I admitted, "I don't know."I felt obligated to natter on a bit, about Professor Director Rousseau's theories of differential sand transport and dune evolution (who really gave a plug?), about the desertification problem across North Africa, about what it might be like to live in Nairobi, about what it might be like to apartment hunt in an African city. I was getting way ahead of myself.I was glad that my news had knocked Jennifer off her high horse and kilter, but I was also a little embarrassed to be boasting in front of Sara, such a modest and unassuming soul. It felt maybe a little bit like getting caught in the act of painting graffiti on a church wall. Sacrilegious.But as for Jennifer, she and I were so totally different; we might have been raised on opposite sides of the globe; we weren't really from the same country at all. I was from that small but unified country occupied by myself, my father and my mother. She seemed to hail from an island adrift in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, far from West and far from East. I clearly recognized that my antipathy towards her were the feelings of a bigot. For this, I was as disgusted with myself as I was with her.***As soon as I stepped through the living room door, the irritation, the anger, the resentment, the embarrassment, the shame, the perverse self-satisfaction, the self-recrimination that had driven me from the porch dissipated completely, for I was once again in the presence of my mother, I was once again secure in her ever-lasting love.  Since our return from Bitterfield, I had been constantly on the verge of seeing her from out of the corners of my eyes. Of hearing her soft voice beneath the cacophony of daily sounds. Of walking into a room to find left out in the open a shirt she had folded for one of us, some items she had neatly put away, a book she had been reading, a tiny pill of paper she had been tossing around to predict her children's fortunes. Late at nights, while sitting at the dining room table reading magazines or writing letters, I would lay my head down on crossed arms and imagine her fingers combing through my hair. Again and again. With the gentleness of a caressing summer's breeze. As always, I was her little boy.  ***This night, this moment, I walked happily across the living room and through the memorabilia-crammed dining room. Therefore, poking my head into the kitchen, I was taken aback, perhaps even startled to find Father sitting at the table, weeping.I said, "Ba, what's wrong?""These chopsticks," he said holding up an ivory pair. "They belonged to your mother." He covered his face.As I went to him, I saw that the table's shallow drawer was pulled open. "Ba," I said and rested a hand on his shoulder. Inside the drawer lay many shiny chopsticks. "Ba," I repeated, and he shook his head, the tremor of his body passing into my fingers.  "Maybe we could go over the family finances?" I suggested hopefully. "Just like you wanted ... in case something should happen to you?"Father's shaking started slowly to subside. I looked at the clock on the wall. It was ten twenty-four.  I glanced at the sink and saw that the day's dishes had been washed and neatly stacked. After a moment longer, Father said, "Alright.... Just give me a minute."I backed out of the kitchen and sat down at the dining room table while he collected himself. After a time, I heard the screech of the table drawer sliding shut. A few minutes more, and my father emerged from the kitchen. "Guang," he said, "help me with something in the basement." "Don't you want to go over the finances?" I asked."Something else first.""Are you sure?""Yes. I'm sure.""Well ... alright then."Stooped over and clutching the small of his back, Father walked slowly, ever-so-slowly towards the basement door.  He balled his hand into a fist and pounded feebly against his lower spine. I asked, "Is it the pain that you felt this morning?"There came no answer.He reached the basement door and started down the stairs, an uncertain pause between each step. I followed close behind, poised to grab the back of his shirt if he should stumble and begin to pitch forward. I would have scooted down around and in front of him, but the staircase was too narrow for maneuver. In any case, we made it all the way down without mishap.In the basement I helped Father clear away the top of a small wooden bookcase. I dusted it off. Next, he dispatched me back upstairs to gather a tiny framed photo of Mother in her youth plus significant odds and endsa piece of her favorite jewelry, an apple-sized block of cloudy white jade that had once belonged to Mother's illustrious father, Jennifer's Barbie doll, my plastic donkey, missing an ear. Father set each item on the shelf, mindful to leave space in the center for the urn containing Mother's ashes. This he placed last and with especial care, adjusting the position five or six times until the sides of the urn seemed exactly perpendicular to the front of the bookcase, until the front and back of the urn seemed exactly at the same distance from the borders of its platform.We lit three incense sticksone for each surviving member of the familyand rooted these in a lump of moist clay planted on a fine porcelain plate.  Three wavering threads of smoke rose into the air above the makeshift alter."Please forgive us," said Father addressing the urn. "We should have attended to things much earlier, but I was too busy with myself, bleating like a lamb, clinging selfishly to my sorrow. Guang Guang and Ping Ping didn't know any better either. But now ... now we have finally made a proper place for you.  If there is anything you want added or taken away, just let me know.  Perhaps you could tell me in a dream? Perhaps you could come to me in my sleep? I've got plenty of time: all night long. I won't be doing anything or going anywhere in my dreams.  I will be just waiting for you. Always."Father went on to discuss the situation with the house. The situation with Jennifer. He seemed to noticeably perk up when it came to the U.N. letter and its implications. He mentioned the active interest I had taken in family finances, so Mother could rest assured that the money she had struggled so hard to amass through shrewd investments would not be lost through his own foolhardy sorties into the stock market. He asked Mother please not to wander too far from home. But if the desire to travel grew keen, if she felt the compulsion to spread her wings and see the world (if not the universe) she was to come back frequently to check and see if his body had worn down. That his constitution was at the moment still solid did give cause for concern and apology, yet just this morning this creaky old body of his had begun to show clear and unambiguous symptoms of deterioration. He hoped sincerely that Mother would not have to wait too long.  When his day finally came, he promised that their ashes would be mixed together. He promised that Jennifer and I would carry their single urn back to China for burial. With that, Father closed his address and relinquished the floor to me.Taken thoroughly off my guard, I was initially at a loss for words. I hastily thought up a few remarks about how we were doing the best we could with the house cleaning and gardening, doing everything in our power to look after Father, making sure that Jennifer too got enough to eat, etc. Father's health was fine if not one hundred percent, and Jennifer was fine too. Mother was not to worry. A quick glance my father's way assured me that this favorable critique of his health had not caused offense. In fact, he seemed a little bit choked up. I quickly finished with a promise to come and talk to her again. Father started actually to clap his hands in applause. He told me I had spoken admirably. He told me that I was a budding orator, like Chairman Mao himself. T'was the blind and utter bias of parenthood. And then Father asked for Jennifer. So I went back upstairs and out onto the porch, but neither Jennifer or Sara was anywhere to be seen.***It wasn't until a quarter till twelve that I finally caught up with Jennifer at Taps, the neighborhood bar. Taps was a comparatively small establishment, one perpetually dark, with but the illumination of a couple of televsion sets, as though the proprietor had yet to learn about the technology of light bulbs. A "U"-shaped bar counter dominated the space, and several small, round, chest-level tables were distributed around the fringes of the room. Jennifer sat on a tall stool at one of these high tables.  "Where's Sara?" I asked, mounting my own stool a little like a cowboy getting into the saddle."She just went home," said Jennifer. Her attention seemed glued to a soap commercial playing one of the TVs behind the bar. "Didn't you see her?" "Nope.""You must have taken different ways."Jennifer nursed a full glass of wine. Another glass still one third full had been pushed to the side. Over the course of the last few days I had noticed that it was my sister's habit never to finish a glass of wine as though the infrugal amount left over attested to some sort of temperance. When the waitress came to our table I asked for a beer. A bottle of Becks. When the waitress left again, Jennifer wasted no time in stating flatly, "You can't go to Africa.""Why not?""Because then I'll have only Dad here, and what if he should die?" "I'm taking him with me," I said. "That is if he wants to go.""Nooo," moaned Jennifer, and her eyes grew large and fierce. "You can't take Dad with you.  He'll die in Africa. I have to take care of him."The waitress returned with my order. Jennifer held her tongue.One morning when I was four years old, Mother and I had been waiting for Jennifer on our front porch, looking forward to a walk downtown in the warm autumn sunshine. But then Jennifer had burst out of the door wailing, both hands cupped over an eye. Mother had pried apart her hands to find the pupil red and watery. Jennifer had claimed I'd poked her, but of course, nothing of the sort had happened. Be that as it may, the physical evidence had struck Mother as appalling and incontrovertible; no child could possibly contrive to injure herself so severely. As a consequence, I was punished with equal severity. Even at night, in the privacy of our own room, Jennifer still refused to divulge even the slightest hint of the truth. Undoubtedly, she had been up to some mischief that had to be kept secret from Mother and had had an accident. Such was the nature of my sister's character. Jennifer had always been up to some stupidity and lied so much about it that now the capacity to see truth was really quite beyond her. She wanted Father around purely to save herself from being alone. Forget that he would be forgotten and neglected. Forget that she wouldn't talk to him anymore than she would a canary in a cage or a fish in a fish bowl.The waitress finished pouring my beer and left us alone again. I picked up the glass and started to drink."Guang," she whined, trying to keep the volume of her voice under control, failing miserably to conceal the tendrils of stress invading her tone. "Say you won't take Dad to Africa.""Look," I said. "I don't even have a job offer yet. Okay?""But what if you get one next week," she said, "or next next week? Say you won't take him. Say you won't.""Dad can do whatever he pleases.""Gua - aang." Jennifer reached for my wrist, to grab a hold of it, to dig her long fingernails into the flesh, hopefully piercing a vein, but I knew all about the talons and pulled my arm away. She took hold of the table instead."Dad can do anything he wants," I reiterated."Gua - aang!" she said shaking the table so that the iron base rattled loudly. Glancing around, I saw a couple of beefy college boys looking our way. "Gua -aang!" she repeated.We walked home through a trashy alley that served mainly as automobile access to the parking basements of large non-descript apartment buildings. Upon entering our house, the first thing Jennifer did was march into the kitchen and take from the drying rack a glass mug. Stepping to the refrigerator, she announced, "I don't know if I'm going to go downstairs or not. I may not. I haven't decided. I just don't know."I said, "What do you mean you don't know? You have to go downstairs. You have to go talk to Mom."She opened the refrigerator and took out her bottle of white wine. "I don't have to do anything." She laughed."Yeah, but Dad wants you to." After pouring herself a drink, she came out into the dining room. She shook her head and said, "I don't know if going downstairs to talk to an urn would be the Christian thing to do.""It's the Chinese thing to do."She put her mug down on the table. "But my values are Christian.""In case it slipped your mind," I said, "you just happened to be Chinese before you were Christian." Jennifer crossed her arms. She smiled and shook her head. "Mom's not down there. She wouldn't be able to hear me talking anyways. Because Mom's up in heaven." "Go down  and talk to her!" Taking a deep breath, I added in a tempered, softer, measured, careful voice, "Because what if she can hear you?" "Nuh-uh," said Jennifer. "She can't, and I won't ." "You became Christian," I spat, unable any longer to hold anything back, "because being Chinese  didn't let you fit in!"There passed a long, tense moment of silence. An old familiar hatred filled my sister's eyes, filled it like the red glow of flames visible through the peep hole of a furnace. Jennifer hissed, "Shuuut up." "All you have to do to fit in," I said, "all you have to do to attract men ... to appeal to Mr. Run-of-the-Mill ... to find yourself a Mr. Right-for-You and secure his affections ... is to ... not ... drive him away.""Shuuut uuup," sang Jennifer, snatching a magazine off the dining room table and curling it into a paper baton."And don't give me any more guff about finding work. You may hate your job, you may hate studying to become a nurse, you may hate having to 'learn the proper technique' for wiping somebody else's shit off of somebody's else's fat ass, you may hate and despise and absolutely loathe your very existence, but I am not going to hate mine." She pitched the magazine at my head, just as she'd done with a pair of scissors when we were kids, aiming for an eye, hoping to hit at least between the eyes, maybe sending the shiney metal into my little boy's pee-and-piss brain, but the magazine fanned open and dropped to the floor. Father appeared at the basement doorway. He had on pajamas and a nightrobe. He had on thin blue socks and thick cloth slippers. He tilted his head forward. He gazed out at us over the top of his glasses.  The frown on his face told me that he had been waiting all this time before her urn, that is before my mother. Switching off the basement light, he turned his back on his children. Slowly again, feeling the pain deep in his back and hips, he shuffled at tortoise pace into the black interior of an unlit room.Two Skies     vPtherefore, a little ossiblysimpler that I hath that had backfired and nowjgd``fo{wekqu{_NWblw\GNW_fraP[hvM=Nfd_iV@Rkk>7Mf}'9WyT$!<YvxnveLbvjtkimF=oK"HtwSDEXvtpumW80JpocgsyiJ56U?

7#$VjpV0`W`Wdddde2e2e2e>eNededexe2fh fj*jkdjf jjpV,jjjjjjChapter 2: The Wake & A Collection of JarsOne afternoon during Mother's brief home convalescence after her first surgery we had indulged in a family photo session. Mother had worn her hair in a thick, long braid; she had dressed in a loose green nightgown with one of Father's white t-shirts worn underneath.  Sitting on the long sofa beneath the living room windows, with her arms wrapped around the shoulders of her glum husband and self-conscious son, Mother's broad smile had never been quite so benign or quite so engaging and triumphant.It was our good luck that the camera, under the handling of its automatic trigger, had captured this essence with stunning clarity on the very last frame of its roll.  This image was expanded to poster size, and a flower-embroidered black silk shawl was draped around it to cloak the two superfluous faces. Such was Mother's portrait at her memorial service.I confess to having fought hard to prevent a memorial service, which both Father and I considered to be too public for a private soul like Mother. But Jennifer had insisted. She had said that Mother's life had not been confined to this house and our family, no matter what I thought. She had said that Mother's life had become a part of the larger life of our town. Our mother was beloved by more people than I realized.  Wouldn't the community appreciate a service at which to pay final respects to a woman whose English had never failed to baffle and whose smile had never failed to charm?  Jennifer, in the sobriety of day, was entirely too eloquent for my comfort, so I voted a firm 'no'.  But in her cunning stubbornness, my sister enlisted the support of our family doctor, and it was this woman's influence that ultimately prevailed upon Father.  A single narrow stone path led up to the university chapel's front entrance. As we met and greeted each person who arrived at the service, it soon became evident that people came from all directions, along totally unrelated paths that converged only at this one sad juncture. Out of the past appeared the young men and women who had lived in our upstairs apartment as students. Out of the campus masses emerged dozens of Chinese students.  Chinese faculty members and businessmen whom Father had publicly chided and tiraded over political differences attended just as did Father's political allies. From the realm of Father's retired career came former work associatesbureaucrats in three piece suits and scientists in cardigans. From his current incarnation as a potter came the artists.  High school classmates of Jennifer's who still resided in town came accompanied by their parents, and total strangers came alone.I remember the speeches but none of the words.  A young Chinese woman in a flower-patterned dress delivered as much of her speech as she could before succumbing to tears. A willowy young man in a roomy suit spoke on behalf of the university's mainland Chinese students. Our family physician read her carefully composed statement, and Pastor Burman spoke without notes. I told a story from my childhood.Mother in her green night gown and Father's tee-shirt smiled joyfully from her place in front of the central aisle. The assembly before her responded with solemn stares, quiet weeping and a few smiles. Father sat in the front row, his back bowed by grief, his beard wet with tears. Jennifer tried to support his crushed spirits by holding his hand.The reception after the service was held in our tiny house into which crammed thirty or forty people. The dining room table was laden with pies and pastries, egg rolls and stuffed dumplings, orange scented beef and spiced chicken, jadeite prawns and meat balls with sesame seeds. Father and I plied our guests with beer, wine, whiskey and vodka.  Jennifer accomodated the temperate with juices and soft drinks.We ate, drank, told stories and laughed.  The noise in the dining room masked the confusion in the kitchen. Someone spilled wine on the living room carpet. The guests spilled out onto the front porch.Before the porch rose trellis, a massive troll of a man with a shiny scalp, bristly beard and beetle brows boisterously toasted Fatherhis brother potter and partner in "mud". With a half-full bottle of vodka in one hand and a red ceramic mug in the other, Father accepted the tribute with an impish grin and rolling eyes. I joined the pair holding a tall glass, and the three of us emptied the bottle of vodka.By mid-afternoon the large dining room table was a palette of crumbs, bones, crumpled napkins, empty paper cups, drained glasses and dirtied plates. Guests started leaving in twos and threes. The last five guests left all at once, and I watched as Father walked them down our front walk, trying in vain to coax his troll-like friend to stay a little longer. He came back up the sidewalk alone, a thin smile on his face. Now the house was suddenly quiet but for the sound of Jennifer collecting party liter. "Well, well," said Father softly. "They came for your mother. See how many there were? They all remember her."I called for my sister to come help me gather Father back into the house. The two of us gently led him to his room, where he wearily undressed and climbed into bed. We sat with him recounting memorable moments of the festivities, and soon he was fast asleep.Jennifer started on the dishes while I watched over the old man. Leaning back in the large chair next to his bed, I found something hard jammed down between the seat cushion and arm rest. It was my small cassette player, with a fresh tape inside. I hadn't interviewed Father since before IC, before the ventilator, so he must have been recording on his own. But why? I found myself thinking back on the story, wondering were the ragamuffin boy and his ragamuffin little brother were now? Still kicking around the squalid streets of their muddy, backward little town? Or had better fortune and their father's bad luck at the gambling table taken them back to Hat-topped Mountain? I smiled at the idea of it and adjusted the cassette recorder's volume control to very low. I switched on the machine.My father somehow managed to get Second Uncle to take me back, and Second Uncle promptly made me into a servant. For the brief time that I worked in the kitchen, the cooks and butlers called me "the young master," which put Second Uncle to shame. So in the end, he passed me onto Elder Uncle, who made me into a nephew again.One winter's day, Elder Uncle took me to the local hospital. As we walked down its low-ceilinged, dark corridor, his hand rested upon my shoulder. I remember this distinctly because I was so unused to being touched by an adult or, for that matter, any human being. So this light contact made me feel ill at ease. The stone floor was cold, or so I imagined since I wore cloth-bottom shoes that afforded a minimal degree of insulation. But outside, the cold of the frozen ground easily penetrated the thin soles of my slipper-like shoes and made my toes ache."Will Ming-xu have a room by himself?" I asked timidly."He'll probably sleep with Uncle and Auntie," said Elder Uncle.Daring to turn my head but slightly, I nevertheless caught a glimpse of Elder Uncle's thick arms and wide chest. A wolverine of a man beneath his long, dark official's gown. "Will he," I asked further, "have candy to eat?""Of course."I almost asked, "Why did Second Uncle take Ming-xu?" but who didn't know the answer? Although Auntie had given birth to a girl, Second Uncle still wanted a boy.  That Ming-xu was handsome and well-mannered made him an attractive prospect for son. I was but an ugly dolt. Despite such sobering, demeaning considerations, I actually started feeling a little more comfortable and relaxed as we walked slowly down the corridor. Perhaps it was the recognition of truth, the avoidance of denial. Perhaps it was happiness on behalf of my little brother. Or perhaps it was the presence of he whom I considered trustworthy, he who proposed to make me a surrogate son with or without my obvious shortcomings.I looked up at my new guardian. His expression was stony. I asked the man, "Are you a citizen of New China?"Elder Uncle stopped, drawing me to a halt as well. I asked, "Am I to live New China too?"My guardian considered me momentarily and then said in a robust voice, "This is 'New China', and we will live in it together." "Oh," I said. This was New China, and we were to live in it together.... Whatever happened to Old China? Everything looked about the same as before. In truth, I hadn't noticed any differences at all. Or had the country perchance metamorphosed before my birth or, at least, my age of consciousness?Up ahead, our guide, a shriveled little Taoist abbot who acted as hospital custodian, turned the corner and disappeared from view. Nevertheless, the faint light of his lantern shone for several seconds longer."New China is not another country," explained Elder Uncle.  "It is this country, our country. We already belong to it. It's called 'new' because its different from in the past. It's changed.  There's been a revolution.  Whereas in the old days China was an empire with an emperor, now it is a republic with a president." An awkward smile flickered across the man's face, and he opened his mouth to inhale deeply. I could see the fog of his breath as he exhaled again. He pushed against the small of my back, and we continued down the corridor. Walking past an open window, I squinted through a bright, broad shaft of light. Outside, the houses and streets were covered by a thin veil of freshly fallen snow. On our early morning walk to the hospital, the snow had crunched underfoot. I had longed to feel it with my fingers, for I loved to play with snow on the very rare occasions that it fell, aching cold or not."This is 'New China'," repeated Elder Uncle with a snort.  "It has a buffoon for a president."It was 1914. During the last three years, a revolution had toppled a dynasty, a republic had risen and already failed, quickly decayed really, like a piece of half-eaten fruit left out under the sun on a hot summer's day.  But what did any of that mean to a pass-around boy? My fingers and toes were numb. I pinched the ends of my sleeves and pulled down on them to cover as much of my hands as I could with the padded material of my jacket. The cold, the immediate circumstances, the lack of glorious snow, these were all that I had a head for.  We turned the corner to come almost immediately to an open door.  We entered and found the abbot's kerosene lantern sitting on a wooden table. I looked to my uncle, but he paid me no heed. I looked back at the table and surveyed its clutter of glass jars and clay urns. Scanning the room, I saw row upon row of tables and shelves, all of them stocked with jars and urns.  The contorted silhouette of the little abbot glided noiselessly down an aisle like perhaps the light-absorbing form of a mountain spirit.  Elder Uncle put a hand on my shoulder and led me after the abbot.  Elder Uncle asked, "Got it?""Somewhere here, your excellency," answered the abbot in a low-pitched voice. "Somewhere here. I almost have it. Just a minute longer."I saw that the jars on the tables were filled with opaque liquid.  In this liquid were suspended objects, but exactly what these objects were, I could not make out. There was a dull scratching sound. A tiny flame flared in the darkness. The abbot's face came suddenly into view, its cracks and creases cast in an orange glow. A string of saliva hung down from his open mouth.  After a few seconds he began to wave the flame wildly.  Once again, the darkness swallowed him up, but a long moment later a second tiny flame burst into life."Those foreign matches are expensive," cautioned Elder Uncle in a stern voice."Yes, your excellency," agreed the abbot obsequiously. He smiled and half kowtowed."Take the lantern," instructed Elder Uncle."But then you and the young master .... I would not presume""No matter. But make haste. Time is not for wasting." "Thank you, thank you," mumbled the abbot retreating to our position, and then he quickly continued his search with the aid of the lamp's steady light.  Now that we were in pitch blackness, Elder Uncle chuckled with thick contempt. "You may well live to see the day," he said, "that the Chinese become a subject nation. A slave race. How can it be otherwise? The 'magic' of simple matches sets us in awe!" Elder Uncle laughed again, his laughter devoid of the the slightest hint of mirth.  "As if we could make matches ourselves, even if they let us. Do you know who 'they' are?"I shook my head."The Swiss," he said. "Colossal China can not, may not, does not dare to make matches because tiny Switzerland won't let her."I hadn't the faintest idea who "the Swiss" were. And where in Asia was "Switzerland"? Couldn't be all that big because we took up so much of the map. I had seen a map of Asia just the other day in Elder Uncle's library. He himself had showed me. I said, "Yes, Elder Uncle, yes," because a response seemed appropriate, even perhaps expected, and I didn't want to disappoint the man. Nevertheless, there the issue of matches and the right to their manufacture ended for me. Soon thereafter, the abbot returned to my guardian with a jar clamped securely beneath one arm. "Put it on the table," said Elder Uncle, and the abbot did as he was told, setting the lantern next to the jar. Elder Uncle squatted so that his face was level with mine.  "Look carefully," he said. "And tell me what you see." He turned to face the jar and its contents.The light of the lantern cut through the opaqueness of the liquid inside the jar, for I could see bits of black matter settling slowly like pieces of torn seaweed drifting through murky water, like perhaps burnt snowflakes falling through smoke. Elder Uncle pushed the lantern still closer to the jar. I leaned forward and peered inside, peered into the mysterious liquid."Do you know what you are looking at?" asked my guardian. "Can you see?"I nodded.  "Can  you?" he asked."I can," I gasped. "I can." It was a severed penis. "You're a clever boy."I exhaled as quietly and unobtrusively as I could manage, as if stealth would somehow cloak me from some vague, unspecified danger. I gulped a deep breath of stale air and held it. There was the trace of an unknown chemical scent in the air.The half-rotten penis was covered with open lesions. Something small and round seemed to peek out from under a tattered flap of skin."Before this man finally died," said Elder Uncle, "his urine turned bright red with blood. He drank only one cup of water a day because it burned like fire to piss, it cut him like tiny knives shaving away layers of flesh from the inside. He grew so thin that his sunken eyes and toothy grin conjured a skull. All death had to do was to scrape away the last soft layer of putrid flesh, scrape away the pusey sores and festering wounds. "This man was a sedan carrier.  I have ridden on his shoulders many a time. He slept with whores because he couldn't afford a wife. Sedan carriers never have children or homes. When he contracted some whore's disease, I paid him a death wage so that he might rot in some small degree of comfort. How would you like to become a sedan carrier?"Unable to answer, I quickly gulped another breath of stale air, contaminated and disease laden for all I knew.Elder Uncle nudged me with a finger; I shook my head. He gently took hold of my shoulders and turned me around. I exhaled, afraid to hold my breath under his scrutiny. But now I had to pant to recover from the deprivation of oxygen. "There," said the guardian. He pointed to a jar containing a swollen, black tongue, like some strange, gorged sea cucumber."There."A clutch of mangled fingers, the bare yellowed bone visible at the broken ends."There," he whispered, and I saw a pair of eyes lying at the bottom of a large glass beaker, the farther one looking away, the nearer seeming to stare at the lantern that illuminated it.  Elder Uncle said, "This barbaric world you've been born into, this pathetic excuse for a country, it knows no mercy. Still, you have your chance to escape a glass jar." Elder Uncle patted me on the shoulder. "My fine young gallant, it's time to leave childhood behind and prepare for life, prepare for the coming battle and struggle."The message, the lesson, the forewarning was clear. The mission of my life, from this moment forward, was to escape a glass jar, filled with foul and nauseating chemical. The personal mandate of this unpromising little boy was to create a life that preserved his limbs, to lead a lifestyle that was clean and septic, to make something of himself more than a beast of burden, to make of himself someone of at least small consequence, someone nevertheless as far above the squalid, dangerous level of the streets as the birds in the sky above the ants that crawled and the worms that writhed only to be snatched up and crushed or pinched in to pieces by the beaks of the ever-hungry birds.Elder Uncle asked, "Do you not agree?""Yes," I immediately responded, in a loud and resounding voice, not merely because such a response was expected of me, not merely because I was sudenly afraid of or intimidated by Elder Uncle as everybody else was, but because this was what I myself wanted to say, what I wanted to shout, make known to Elder Uncle, to the abbot, to the jars and their pieces of the deceased, to the ghosts that loitered about in the vicinity of their former parts and, most of all, to myself. "Yes." Elder Uncle did take me home to live with himself and his family, but for no more than a few weeks. A month after the visit to the abbot's laboratory, I was sitting at a desk in a boarding school dormitory room, shivering madly beneath my pair of padded jackets and single padded trousers. The air temperature inside was just as low as it was outside, though I was grateful for the shelter from the wind. I looked down at the book set before me and, through the thin clouds of my breath, examined a page full of arithmetic problems.  In absolutely every subject, I was dead last in my class.  Abysmally behind the others. If Elder Uncle was to be taken at his word, this one semester would be all the proving time I had.  Failure to show some glimmer of promise would result in my removal from the rolls.  At age ten, I was already too old to be apprenticed to a tradesman; Elder Uncle had thoroughly investigated that practical option.  What other future for me except as a beast of burden? I turned my head to look out my dormitory room window. The stream just beyond the school wall had not frozen over, and its currents carried tiny rafts of ice.  The tubular stalks of marsh grass fringing the banks were yellow, perhaps not unlike the yellow hair of Europeans, which one of my classmates had talked about. Through the tall dead grass, I could see the snow on the ground. I had heard the grounds keeper say that this winter of unprecedented bitterness had not been foretold by omens.  It seemed to me that the winter itself might be an omen.I pulled a folded sheet of fine rice paper out from between the cover and front page of my mathematics exercise book.  As I unfolded it, my heart sank.  I smoothed out the page, and the paper's voice taunted me further. I began to read: "Dearest Elder Brother. "Auntie tells me that Elder Uncle has sent you to school in Guiyang. She tells me that you are happy. When I asked to send you a message, she asked my tutor Master Zhen to help me write it."The calligraphy was indeed beautiful. By my untutored reckoning it was good enough to hang in a gallery. I had never before actually set foot in a gallery of fine art, but it was difficult to imagine a higher standard."Are you happy? What are you learning? Do you have many friends? Is there a woods to play in? Master Zhen is teaching me the analects. Do you study the analects too? Do you study Tang couplets or the Saga of the Three Kingdoms? I am learning how to handle a brush. Master Zhen says that my black ink bamboo leaves stand out as though they were real. I tell him that I am familiar with bamboo. I tell him that you and I have seen it in spring and summer, autumn and winter. We have seen it reaching up towards the sun and beaten down by the rain. We have seen it tossed by the wind. It is only with snow that we have not seen it...."I stopped reading and folded the letter back up again. I slipped it into its place between the cover and front page of my book. I turned back to my arithmetic problems, but in my mind I continued to recite Ming-xu's letter. "If I can master bamboo with snow, Uncle promises me a new set of wolf's hair brushes."I stared down at my book, at the numbers piled one on top of the other on the page, at the tiny arithmetic symbols that marshaled these unruly digits.  The numbers and symbols gradually gave way to a vision of a still higher authorityMing-xu dressed in a black silk gown. Black was the color of justice, which accorded with Second Uncle's ambition. His son would someday be a magistrate.Across the stream, a man under a load of wood trudged through a bamboo grove. He was bundled in a coat of straw, which gave him the fantastic appearance of a large, quilled animal. A broad bamboo hat hid his face. As the man emerged from the grove, his load of wood brushed a clump of long, sharp-ended bamboo leaves, knocking off the snow and allowing the leaves to spring back up. The bamboo waved gratefully to its unwitting liberator, who was just then wading into the cold, cold stream. Was this a vision of my future?Two Skies     vbut O had with painhad the  in town.

7#$>X2AFWFWLuLuLuLtLLLMMM#M#MxLN' NGR}*R_LuR}N] R}R}X,R}R}R}R}R}R}Chapter 3: A Trek Across the Mountains"The mountains were so many that they stretched out before us like the giant waves of a frozen sea." Father's voice was low, and I worried that the microphone of my portable cassette recorder was not picking him up."Ba," I said. "Are you sure you want to do this today?"He nodded yes.The faint whirl of the cassette recorder's tiny rotating cogs seemed to dominate the comparatively cavernous room. Father looked down at the table top. I turned to the window and the soundless scene outside.  A bee flirted with blossoms. The breeze teased the treetops. The clouds far above moved at an imperceptible pace across the mid-morning sky. I looked back down at the recorder and turned it off."What are you doing?" asked Father listlessly, looking up with bloodshot eyes."We can do this later."Jennifer had gone back to California the day before. I had driven her to the airport at Harrisburg while Father stayed home. He had adamantly resisted our entreaties for him to ride along because he feared an accident.  It wasn't the possibility of death that scared him.  In fact, he might have courted it if he could. But the thought of all three of us going in a single stroke was an overwhelming unlikelihood. Then our family assets, which had been so painstakingly amassed by Mother, would be confiscated by the state. I wondered if it would be necessary to adopt a child as "back-up" generation."We haven't recorded in almost two weeks now," he noted, his voice soured by just a hint of alarm."That's alright," I said, trying to reassure him with a smile. "We can catch up later. Tomorrow maybe."Father sighed and stared blankly before him.I understood that he wanted to go on, to keep travelling, to fight his way back to life, and the only way he seemed to know how was through the recorder and the telling of his life past.  But since the memorial service, his aches and pains had resumed with great severity. It took all morning to coax him outside for a stroll of a few blocks, which required as long as two hours. And then I had to brace him at every curb."When are you leaving for Africa?" he asked."I don't know," I said. "I haven't heard from the U.N. since I mailed them my thesis.""Then you have to go somewhere else?""Why?""Because there aren't any jobs here. No decent jobs anyways. You told me yourself that the university hasn't any openings in your field. You have to go somewhere bigger. A real city."This was for him a long, drawn-out speech, and it seemed to take something out of him. He sat there, lightly panting, and I wondered if he was feeling dizzy again."I don't have to work in my field," I said. "I can try to find a job with one of the small companies around here. Like maybe as a technical writer. You never know. Somebody here might need a technical writer."To this hopeful prospect he made no response. For several minutes he did nothing, nothing at all. He simply sat there, hands braced against the knees, eyes vacuous, with nothing to focus on, nothing to look forward to, nothing good anyways since his daughter had already left home and his son was destined to do the same. Unlike perhaps before my mother's death, my father was no longer one to harbor illusions. Finally, I switched the recorder back on and conceded, "Okay. Maybe if you tell the story just a little bit, you'll work up an appetite for lunch."He sighed again. After a few moments more, he suddenly began."I did reasonably well in school that first year.... I did better the second and third years.... In the fourth year I was one of the three top students of my class, and for the first time since I had become a student, Elder Uncle granted me the permission to come home for a visit.  "We left for Anshun the day after winter exams. My traveling companions were two classmates who also came from Anshun and a boy from Anshun who attended a different school.  The mountains through which we hiked were not high.  Each day we climbed from valley to ridge and descended to valley again.  The main roads, however, were dangerous. We four boys were defenseless against brigands, who would at the very least have robbed us and at the worst have cut our throats or taken us captive to work as their scribes and accountants.  So we took difficult, unmarked trails, which the bandits couldn't be bothered with."The eldest boy acted as guide, and he quickly became 'the pathfinder', a nickname that he seemed to relish.  The dullard among us became 'stone head', which is a pun on the phrase 'thoroughly drenched'. I was 'the scholar', not because I was the smartest of the foursome but because I was the most serious in demeanor, always staying aloof from schoolboy jokes and pranks. Our leader was the boy from a different school. His name was Han Wen Huan. By far, the sharpest of us; we called him 'the hawk'."The hawk was often quiet, lost in thought it outwardly appeared. And absolutely nothing perturbed him. Whatever our circumstances, he remained absolutely calm. This maturity gave us all confidence during a trek of considerable uncertainty. There was no guarantee that we would reach our desired destination. None at all. All the more why we appreciated his good cheer and wit. Sometimes he would have fun at your expense, but his cuts were so subtle that it always took a pause to catch on.  By then he was several steps ahead of you and laughing. Even then I believe I sensed that he would grow up someday ... to do amazing things.... Unbelievable things."Father chuckled wryly. But then his smile curdled as though he had tasted something foul and rotten. What sort of amazing, unbelieveable things were he alluding too? Did something unfortunate happen to the hawk, for instance an untimely demise?I asked, "What is it?"***Father shook his head and covered his eyes with a hand. I thought for a moment that he might begin to cry. Did he care that deeply for the hawk? Was it a long-dormant, decades hibernating gratitude unexpectedly revived by this narrative?"What is it?" I repeated. "Something to do with the hawk.""We ate at roadside stands," he resumed abruptly, ignoring my questions and still shaking his head as though to ward off a past evil, "and we slept in roadside inns. The distance from Guiyang to Anshun was two hundred and ten li or about seventy miles. We managed perhaps twenty-three miles each day. After three days, we reached Anshun. ***"I went immediately to my parents' house, but found it occupied by strangers. Then I went to Grandmother Man-niang's estate, where I found Mother, who was again with child. When I asked her about Father, she told me that he had sold the fabrics shop and was presently away on business. 'Away on business.'" The old man laughed sardonically. "Even at that young, unseasoned age I understood perfectly that this was a euphemism to obscure the truth. He was out and about our town or the next, sniffing around for penny-ante games or cock fights to bet on, living off of restuarant scraps or garbage in the streets."Father batted the air with his hand and scowled: good riddance. He had nothing for his own father, least of all the minutest sympathy or pity.***"I sought Grandmother out in her chamber and was surprised by how much smaller she seemed than the way I remembered her and significantly more wrinkled. She took my hands in hers. I remember to this day with the vividness of just a second ago how the stone coldness of her callused fingers penetrated my flesh. "Grandmother Man-Niang greeted me with a measure of respect and esteem. She addressed me 'Young Master', as if I were the superior and she the inferior. She called her maid servant to her and instructed the girl to order for me a banquet dinner, away from which I, of course, tried to dissuade her, but who could ever prevail over Grandmother Man-Niang. So we ate until I was stuffed fit to bursting, and that night I slept soundly indeed.***"The next morning, I explored the estate grounds; I was not very familiar, having spent in my childhood but a couple of days here at a time, as a sort of way station between temporary destinations. Grandmother had a root cellar in the rear courtyard, and passing near to it, I heard a knocking on its door. From the inside. Since the door was bolted on the outside, it was possible that someone had been accidentally locked in. Bearing in mind the story of the fox fairy, the blacksmith and his buried children, I approached the root cellar door with a certain degree of skeptical anxiety. "Drawing close I whispered, 'Who's there?' "From the other side rang a familiar voice. 'Help me! Help me!' It was my little brother Ming-xu."I immediately unbolted the door, and my brother crawled out on all fours, his eyes shut tight against the glare of sunlight. Tears streamed down his face. And he howled out his story."He had lived happily with Second Uncle until Auntie had given birth to a boy. So his position within Second Uncle's family as son had been supplanted by the real thing. Ming-xu had been returned to Grandmother, who brought him back here to live with her and Grandfather. But because Ming-xu couldn't sit still for Grandfather's ridiculous lessons or commit to memory countless Tang couplets, he was frequently punished. The old man had at first only whipped him with bamboo switches and then his solid cane.  When that didn't work, he tried locking him away in the root cellar, often for hours. This time, he had simply forgotten about the boy. And nobody's memory had been jogged even by my sudden appearance. It had been two days since my brother had seen the light of day."'I'll bring you water and food,' I said."Between gulps of air he gasped, 'I hate ...' but could not finish the sentimentt."I promised to speak to Grandmother on his behalf, but he only scoffed at my conceit. I tried to comfort him. I helped him to my room. I gave him a cup of water. I went to the kitchen to fetch for him a bowl of rice and vegetables. But during my brief absence, he fled the estate."Throughout the afternoon, I and the household servants searched the town. It was night before we learned that he had been seen around noon time at a local inn. When we questioned its proprietor, he told us that Ming-xu had been talking with some provincial soldiers. The innkeeper offered the opinion that my brother had gone off with them, perhaps to act as valet for a sergeant or junior officer. There was a demand for homeless boys in the growing armies of the regional warlords. "In another year, Yuan Shi-kai would proclaim his new dynasty and supremacy over all the country, and the warlords would rise up to cut him back down to size. Ming-xu probably died in a fringe war somewhere in our southwestern mountains.  But of course, I might be wrong; he might have lived on. All I know is that I never saw him again.  My little brother, all of eight years old."Father pushed the stop button on the cassette recorder. We sat together quietly at the table as the bees outside went obliviously about their business. As time passed, Father continued to decline in health.  Each day he walked a little slower, ate a little less. Shooting pains in his back prompted him to tap almost constantly at his lower spine with a feeble fist.  He no longer watched television or read the newspaper, not even his cherished Chinese dailies that came all the way from Beijing. The early summer days grew warm and long without his notice; the roses in the garden bloomed without his pleasure. I shopped and cooked. I cleaned and did the laundry. I watered the indoor potted plants but let the weeds invade the outdoor gardens. I worried constantly about the old man, who had become my charge. In several ways it was almost as though I was now the parent and he my child. Be that as it may, one day at the end of June or possibly the beginning of July the seasons must have turned, for Father began to get better.  He started to eat again and to sleep. He slowly caught up with his mail and worked away at his pile of accumulated Chinese newspapers.  The pain in his back gradually subsided, and a modest bounce returned to his step.  His grip on life had held; he had stood the trial; he had passed the test. The weeds disappeared from the flower beds and vegetable patch as Father renewed his old vigilance.In August, I began again to pursue personal projects, including the reconstruction of my dissertation, for which there was now an unexpected need.  Having sent the dissertation to Africa by surface mail instead of air, under duress of Jennifer's wild lamentations, I now received notification from the intended recipient, a UN programme sub-director in Nairobi, that after months the manuscript had yet to arrive. I pictured the two hard bound volumes mildewing in some cranny of a ship's hold or interminably sequestered for inspection by the negligent customs officer of a dusty North African port.Two fresh copies were prepared, and one was posted special air delivery to Africa. The other I would carry with me to California where I could await Nairobi's decision (which the UN official indicated could take several months) while allaying anxiety with some sort of contingency employment.  Late as the thesis was, I felt confident that once reviewed by the powers that be it would make a favorable impression.Father approved of my plan wholeheartedly and urged me to leave for California as soon as possible, without delay. The next day even if possible. But that was absurd, and I refused to be cornered into a definite departure date. The old man was still weak and his routine irregular.  I had to make absolutely sure that he could take proper care of himself.  That much I had promised Mother.  Beyond this, I really felt quite content to let the days slip by.  Perhaps Father was traveling enough for the both of us through the telling of his boyhood tales. Perhaps it was Mother's presence, which renewed a childlike outlook, a freshness and blitheness.Before I knew it, September had arrived. The first fall of autumn leaves found Father beneath our tall stout elms with his fingers wrapped around the wooden stem of his old rake, which was missing half its metal prongs.  I bought new light-weight plastic rakes, but Father refused to touch them.  So long as what he already had still did the job, its use was to him imperative.  With Father's ultra-frugality stubbornly asserting itself, I was forced to admit that his survival was no longer in question.  Sadly, I set my departure for the first week of October.One evening as we washed dishes at the sink I asked Father, "Do you want to come along as far as New Orleans?""New Orleans?" he said in a rising voice. "I haven't ever returned after I got my Ph. D. at Baton Rouge.""When did you leave?"After a long moment's contemplation Father said, "Nineteen ...  forty-four.""Well, here's your chance to see your old stomping grounds again.""New Orleans," Father repeated quietly to himself.  He picked up a bowl with his dish towel and began to dry it, smiling as he worked. But after a while, he said, "No."When I asked him why, he expressed fear of detaining me further.  The diversion of New Orleans would be to my detriment. I simply had to get out there to California and its sunny job market. I abruptly ended the discussion by telling him how irrational he was, how illogical.  After six months here at home a few extra days on the road could hardly make a difference to my eminent illustrious carreer. Besides, the change of scenery would do him good. I concluded by noting that the dish water wasn't soapy enough to cut the grease because someone had been a bit stingy with the detergent.Two Skies     v hadthe a littlea sense of the short round trip requiringupwards ofmed to take something out of his frail bodyThe hawk steadied us.

7#$AzqK1HWHWaaaaaaaaaaabexab bg6*g`ag6c g6g6zWg6g6g6g6g6g6Chapter 4: Old Stomping GroundsThe Gulf of Mexico approached as a flat gray horizon beneath a cloudless sky. The sea rumpled into waves before tumbling in frothy curls onto the beach, which was littered with soaked sheets of newspaper, bits of plastic and glass, smashed aluminum cans, automobile tires and barnacle-encrusted wooden boats.  Parallel to the coast stretched the highway, and scattered along this ribbon of shimmering concrete stood dilapidated clapboard houses interspersed by gasoline stations and restaurants with large neon signs.One of these signs exulted, "The Freshest Seafood Anywhere!", which Father read with relish. We stopped there for scallops, which were indeed remarkably savory.  Sated, we sailed on through the highway shimmer, now thicker than before in the heat of mid-afternoon, in the direction of New Orleans.The city's outer limits was a sparse collection of ramshackle huts mainly made of clapboard, wood and corrugated iron. Plastic garbage bags served as protective siding for some of the hovels; clear wrap as window panes.  People's yards were balds of red clay bordered by patches of parched grass and weeds.  A few dogs with wagging tongues roamed the streets.  One old Black man in what looked to be a three-piece suit appeared momentarily at a screen door.As we drove on, the neighborhoods grew dense with houses, many of which appeared in marginally better condition than the ones that had come before. The roads slowly filled with cars and trucks. The sidewalks came to life with human traffic. When brick buildings of two and three stories appeared in the changing cityscape, we knew that we were moving towards the heart of the city.I was a little surprised that I had managed to make it all this way without having to stop for a nap; the big lunch had made me drowsy. I turned on the radio and drifted into a state halfway between daydream and stupor. A minimal alertness kept us on the road and allowed me to take appropriate action with regards to stop signs and moving objects. I haven't a clue what played on the radio during this time.  Perhaps I drifted back to the desolate Outback, preferably to Beijing where in July raucous boys jump feet-first into the palace moat of the Forbidden City.  Wherever I went, when I returned to the present reality I was gliding through a neighborhood with towering elms, gigantic oaks and majestic willows.These streets were immaculate, and the only people strolling them were security guards armed with batons and pistols. Where indeed were we? To our right passed a large stone house with thick white pillars and a second-story balcony.  To our left was another estate of similar architectural style but even more palatial dimensions.  Next came a red-brick Victorian mansion with turret towers reminiscent of the Smithsonian castle in Washington, D.C., and following this was a Tudor cottage of fantastic proportions. On and on they came, each mansion separated from the next by manicured hedges and mown lawns. Then a thick stone column flashed before my eyes, and there were estates no more.The trees were now scrawny. The homes were of a size and ostentation appropriate to the middle class. I glanced up at the rear view mirror to confirm that we had passed through a gate--a portal between two worlds in this city of three.In New Orleans we stayed in a home even more cluttered with memorabilia than our own. The host family was Chinese American, and its patriarch was a man in his late sixties or early seventies. Of average height and weight, Mr. Liu was of above average energy or nervousness. But despite his perpetual motion, he was rather reticent, preferring to listen and smile than to talk. Curiously, when he did open  his mouth, out came a broken "Chinese" English even though he didn't actually speak any Chinese at all. The man had grown up in the linguistic isolation of an Asian ghetto in Honolulu. Mrs. Liu, on the other hand, spoke fine American English. Her particular dialect seemed to owe nothing to New Orleans.  I placed it closer to cities like Rochester, New York, or Pasadena, California.  A standard American English with a suburban beauty parlor twang.  An even clearer example was provided by Mrs. Liu's sister, Roberta."Hey, I remember you," Roberta chirped at Father, batting her mascara fattened eyelashes and pointing at him with a long painted fingernail."Hee, hee, hee," laughed the troglodyte, pointing back at Roberta.  "You remember me?... I remember you."Roberta pressed her chubby fingers against her chest. "Why sure you remember me. I mean, how could you forget?"She broke into peels of rattling laughter as she jabbed her sister with an elbow. I was uneasily aware of the horrifying prospect that Roberta might be Jennifer thirty or forty years down the pike with a beehive hairdo."How could you forget?" she blurted again and took a quick breath to fuel an even louder outburst of laughter.Later that evening in the privacy of the guest room, Father confided to me that "when Miss Liu was young, she was a real stunner."I helped Father put sheets on his bed. "Was she," I asked, "boisterous like she is now?""She was shy and demure.""You're kidding.""I'm not kidding" returned Father.For the first time, I wondered about the state of the old man's memory. Or did this mean that people really could change? That Jennifer's character and fate were not set in stone. Nor mine for that matter."She had an eye for me back then," confessed Father, "but she was a bit too quiet and delicate for my taste. Now, however, I've got to keep an eye on her because ... there might just be an ulterior motive behind her smile.""Ah, come off it!" I barked incredulously, stuffing a pillow into a pillow case."I'm not joking!""You're deluding yourself," I said. "She isn't trying to get you."Father started shaking his head from side to side. "You don't understand the first thing about women, so what would you know?"Annoyed that he wasn't doing his share, I handed Father the other pillow and its pillow case. "Hee hee hee," chuckled Father fumbling with the pillow. "We'd better not stay too long here, and we'd better spend most of our time in the city. We don't want to give Miss Liu any wrong ideas.""Give her all the wrong ideas you want," I challenged, snatching the work from from his hands."Your mother struggled all these years," he said as he watched me finish the job.  "How could I face her someday in heaven if an outsider got a hold of the family wealth?""How could you face her indeed?""For the rest of my life I don't have any more interest  in women. Your mother was the only one for me."I sat down on my cot, which was next to Father's thick twin bed.  Tired, exhausted really, but far too annoyed to sleep, I looked around the room for something to read.Father began to chuckle again as he folded his denim jeans. "But of course," he said, "even if I have no more interest in women, it's better to play it safe."Since at least high school I had heard stories about a seaside park in New Orleans where my father used to come on Sunday afternoons.  For the price of a bottle of beer one was entitled to as much crab and lobster as one could eat. I pictured crowded wooden picnic tables strewn with broken shells, washes of spilt beer and feathery bits of snow-white shell fish flesh riding those pungent flows to tumble over the edges. On our first afternoon, we decided to make a trip to the seaside park for dinner.  The drive out from the French Quarter (which after one day Father claimed he had had his fill of for the rest of his life) was long and confusing.  My navigator had but a hazy idea of the park's location. We navigated by intuition, mine not his, and at every traffic light I raced to mark our position on a map. After a solid hour we were finally on a road leading straight towards a charted green trapezoid that I suspected as our destination. It was hot, I was distracted.  My mind began to drift. As we approached a red light, I glanced into the side-view mirror and turned the steering wheel to take us into the left-hand lane.  Suddenly, a huge tire filled my frame of vision! There was a dull thud, and our car bounced off to the right! We swerved violently, but I quickly regained control and brought the Honda to a stop.Father told me that he wasn't hurt, and indeed, he seemed unshaken.  Looking over my shoulder, I saw a brown Ford pickup parked by the side of the road.  A hefty, middle-aged man in a checkered shirt and jeans was hunched over his bumper. I got out of the Honda and quickly inspected the front of it. The body was badly dented around the side light; the light itself was smashed.  I collected my thoughts and walked towards the man.  Father followed with hands in pockets.As I drew near him, the man raised himself to his full height so that now I arched my head backwards to look up at him. "Hello," I said."Good afternoon," he returned. His thick arms were hairy and tattooed."Are you alright?" I asked."We're fine."I looked past the man and saw a woman in the cab of his truck.  She gave me a smile."You folks alright?" asked the man."We're okay," I said. "Um, should we call the police and our insurance companies?""Well," said my victim. "There isn't any real point in it for me. See?" He pointed to his bumper. There wasn't so much as a scratch. I breathed a sigh of relief.The big man walked with me back to the Honda and gave me some tips on repair. Then I walked him back to his pickup, where Father stood chatting with the woman.  "Aldridge," she said, "these people are all the way from Pennsylvania. This man used to go to school over in Baton Rouge."The man welcomed my father back to the South and expressed his gladness that I had come to Louisiana.  He could not confirm to me that our destination on the map was "the place you get free seafood with beer." So after a cordial goodbye, he got back into his pickup. After it pulled away and disappeared up the road, Father and I walked back to the Honda, the gravel of the side strip crunching beneath our feet."What happened?" asked Father. "I looked in the mirror," I said with irritation. "The road seemed clear. There's a blind spot, you know.  That's true for all cars.""What were you thinking of?" Glancing at the cars whizzing by I said, "Nothing.""Can't be nothing."We got back into the Honda, and I made sure we both had our seat belts buckled. As I restarted the engine, I poked my head out the window and looked behind us. There was no break in the traffic, so I sat back, looked straight ahead and switched on the turn signal. "I was thinking about what it might be like," I said, "if I couldn't find work in California.""You?" said Father with a smirk.  "I never thought I'd hear that from you. I thought you weren't afraid of anything."I looked behind again, and now the coast was clear. We pulled off the gravel strip and drove slowly up to the traffic light, which was once more flashing red. My heart continued to race.The place where we finally arrived at was indeed the seaside park of Father's memories. A paved walk still led through a grassy field toward the sea. The sandy beach, however, was gone. In its place was a concrete embankment that made an abrupt vertical boundary between land and water.Along the paved walk were seven rectangular huts, all of which were covered with weathered and peeling white paint. None had glass windows but, rather, square ventilation ports.  Propped against the wall beneath these windows were their wooden covers, each decorated with brightly colored lettering.  "Seafeast Gumbo", "Cajun Rice", "Sourdough" and "King Crab"."They must just be opening," I said.Father shrugged his shoulders. He leaned close to a large menu painted on the side of one of the huts and lifted his spectacles to read the prices."Where are the picnic tables?" I asked."That was a long time ago," answered Father.I looked at my watch and was amazed to learn that it was already seven. I spotted two restaurant attendants but no patrons."Where are all the people?" I said.Father made no reply."I guess they must come later.""Sometimes it was crowded," Father said flatly. "Usually ... only some people."In an instance I knew. This had never been a place for carousing on Sunday afternoons. This was a place for when you had nowhere else to go. Now I saw. Father had sat alone on the long bus rides from Baton Rouge. He must often have sat alone at the picnic tables. "I think," said Father turning his attention away from the menu, "that you will be alright in California." He put his glasses back on. "Remember what your friend Caitlin told you right before we left? It may take weeks or even months, but you'll get a job.  You have too much ability not to get a job. Maybe even a really good job." He smiled and nodded his head.  "Just be patient." He nodded again. "Yes, a really good job. I'm sure of it. No need to worry."Crab and lobster no longer came free with bottles of beer. They cost plenty. So Father and I split three bowls of gumbo sitting by ourselves at a table inside one of the restaurant huts.  I mentioned to Father that he might like to ride along to Arizona.  Maybe we could take a trip to the Grand Canyon, which he had never before seen.  Maybe he would like to go all the way to California, to visit Jennifer. See her home, meet her friends.  The suggestions brought a smile to the old man's face.  After we finished our gumbo, we quickly left the park by the sea.Father and I patronized a five-star restaurant one evening in the first week of October. We dined on Mississippi catfish with black beans and rice, crab meat so delicate that it seemed to melt on the tongue and red, sweet cherries jubilee.Would he reconsider his decision not to come with me to California? No, he would not.Early the next morning, I drove Father to the airport, where he was scheduled to catch a flight to Philadelphia.  From there he would transfer to a local commuter for our town.  After arriving at the domestic departures terminal, I accompanied Father to the check-in counter. Our business there was concluded very quickly as we were well ahead of the crowd.  Father had insisted on coming several hours before flight time.  It had always been his policy to be extra careful when it came to travel.I walked Father towards his gate, and soon we came to the security check station. I placed Father's green canvas shoulder bag on a moving conveyor belt, which quickly passed it through a curtain of opaque plastic strips into the x-ray chamber. As I stepped up to the check point, one of two security officers, a hefty Black woman with a head of tight braids, asked me for my ticket. Of course I didn't have one. I explained that the flier was my father, that I was only here to keep him company until boarding. The security officer apologized but informed me that airport regulations were very clear and strict with regards to who may and may not pass the check point. If I wanted to keep my father company, we would have to wait in the outer lobby."Well," I said to Father. "We'd better get your bag back.""No," he said moving towards the security officers. "I'll go.""Wait!" I said. "It's still hours before your flight. We might as well go out for a snack or something.""There should be a meal on the plane."I began to laugh. "You'll starve before then. Come on."Father took my hand in his and shook it. "If you don't get on the road soon," he said, "you won't get to San Antonio until late. My friend there tells me that it's a dangerous town after dark." Releasing my hand, he added, "I feel tired. Maybe we stayed up too late last night? Maybe it was the wine. That good French wine. I'm going to the waiting lounge for a nap. I'll be alright."He stepped up to the officer, who waved her metal detection paddle in front of him, then behind him.  She signaled Father to move on. Without hesitation, he crossed the tape on the floor. Turning around, he said, "Good luck."I raised my hand into the air but couldn't speak.  He put his shoulder pack back on, turned again and began to walk away with his hands in his pants pockets. The corridor leading to the flight gate was long and empty. I watched for a time, holding in the tears, but when he didn't look back, I too walked away.Two Skies                              vse, their long tongues,slowly sleepEven now I can hear , as I think of them,their shouts and squeals of joy. @&'~$$AUAVAhAiAjAAAAAAAAAAAAHWHyHHHHHHHHHHHHIIII I,I-IAIBIEIFIoIqIrI{IIIIIIIIJ/J0J<JCJDJJJjJJJJJJJJJJKA@P@Z&'.Y$q%eClJexkLu2|}~& 8!#$$e$$$%&'(,(()g)))+9+,l,m,n-.///00000162@46C6D6E76V7679:v<q<<=W==?:@AUAVAjAAAAAHHHHI I-IBIFIrIIJ0JDJJJJKBKRK\K}K~KKKNYNiN~NNNPPPPPQ.QTQXQQQQRRR,Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C,p$*0-/25p8@;=@C@A on that drive through New Orleansweeping holstered .

7#$]2.$W$W))))<******&*&*x*+* +J/*/)/+c //2,//////Chapter 5: DeparturesThe sun at nine o'clock had still a long climb ahead of it, but the day was already hot and sweltering. I found my car in the parking lot and drove out of the airport.  The highway west was elevated above the bayou, which was indescribably beautiful through the tree tops. Even so, this beauty and the illusion of flight I'd conjured on previous drives across this stretch between New Orleans and Baton Rouge during our brief sojourn were now lost to me.My thoughts drifted back to spring, and I found myself floating in an upper corner of Mother's hospital room, watching her on her bed. "She's not resting easily," I heard myself say. "You can see it in her face. She's constantly shifting position, just a little. She can't sleep. Her body's bloated with medication, and she can't sleep! If only she would sleep. If only she could rest.""It is a race," commented the same inner voice. "A race."Those damned little grapes of cancer. The more decisively the doctors had seemed to act, the faster they had spread until they had grown like vines beneath a black sun, grown beyond their trellis, grown beyond the vineyard and down the road and across the whole of a vast country, grown beyond my mother's life's capacity to contain them."Maybe it was simply her time," conjectured the voice. "In the end every race belongs to the same victor."It felt as though the surging current of my heart's tumult were speeding my car towards the horizon. I desperately wanted to reach the desert; I yearned to be back in the barren lands, to be where all growth was parched and withered by the sun, where vines would be killed, shriveled, shredded to flecks of black debris and swept away by the wind. A clean antiseptic environment, one where I could relax, not worry, be alone. Ahh, the solitude of the wide open kiln, the sandy furnace. But then suddenly ... I realized: Mother was no longer with me. Her spirit had flown. Back to Pennsylvania with Father. But why would she not be with me, at least a little longer? Why would she not come out west, see me through the desert, keep her son company, start him off on his job search? From the tiny woman's presence this son had drawn not solace but strength. She must have known.The trees and bayou and sky all but disappeared as the highway came flying at me at ninety miles an hour, a stone-solid blur. It licked at imagination and the soft tissues of my mind like the machine-speed tongue of an asphalt grinder. Just waiting to smear my life across its hard, coarse palette.In a single stroke, I put an end to both highway and doubt by yanking free my cassette player from the narrow space between the two front seats and jamming in one of Father's tapes. As I began my escape afresh at the fever speed of a hundred an hour and rising, I decided to distract myself with the long journey the old man had long ago taken one step at a time. I pressed "Play".The rain cut trails through the dirt on the glass, and I remember wishing I had washed my windows so that a better view might be afforded of the trees by the brook. Their leaves, already green, glistened with moisture. The winter had stolen away so quietly for a student buried in his books.  But today the sunshine and vivid colors of spring declared themselves and demanded appreciation!  For this reason I deeply resented my unexpected visitor.He sat before me with his legs set apart and his hands on his knees. He stared at the ground as he panted to recover his breath. The climb up the small hill to our school had been taxing."Do you have any water?" he asked without looking up. "Or tea? Perhaps your father would like some tea."I carefully pressed the wet ink out of my brush tip and set it down on its porcelain stand. Still looking over the calligraphy I had just finished, I slowly rose from my desk and walked to the bookshelf, where I kept several bottles of boiled water. "I can't give you any tea.""Why not?""Because I haven't got any."He studied me with knit brows, nodding and brushing the air with his fingers.  "You live simply," he observed.His long gown of faded blue cotton came down to his calves and was decorated by knots of coarse black threadundoubtedly the results of my mother's inept attempts to mend holes.  I poured some water into a cup and carried it to the small stand next to my father's chair and set it down. Immediately he took the cup and brought it to his cracked lips. He drank until the cup was empty and then held it out for more. "My things are down at the gate," he said.Ignoring the cup, I asked, "Why do you tell me?" I held out the bottle of water. My father frowned and banged his cup down on the stand. Taking the bottle, he undid its cork, held it up to his mouth and tossed back his head. When his thirst was quenched he said, "I tell you where my things are so that you may fetch them."I sighed and looked about the room. "Are you staying?""Yes," he said quietly but with menace.I looked away. "I might be able to find a rug for the floor.""You would have your father sleep on the floor?""If I want to graduate I have to pass my exams!" I said with sudden urgency. "And I have only one bed!"His shook his head. "You ..." he started, but then lapsed into a hacking cough.I took the bottle from his hand and refilled his cup. "Drink the water," I said, trying not to look at him. He nodded but couldn't stop coughing to take the cup.Although he was not yet forty-five, his hair was sparse and grey, the skin on his face dull and taut, his eyes sunken.  In his face one could plainly see a skull. I assumed that he was lice infested.  It was minutes before his labored breathing returned to normal.I leaned forward. "You can have my bed, but I can't give you anything else. I have nothing else to give. Elder Uncle doesn't fund me beyond my immediate needs."Meeting my gaze he said, "Have I asked you for anything else?"I shook my head and admitted, "No.""I've come to pay a visit," he said. "To my son."I thought about this for a moment and then said, "Forgive me if my words were unfair."He said nothing in reply but curved his lips into a sneer.After a little longer, I helped him onto my bed, and he fell asleep almost immediately. I walked down to the campus's main entrance to fetch his bundle, which had been left with the gatekeeper.Three days later, I overheard two classmates trading remarks about my questionable conduct. It wasn't long before a small delegation approached me on my father's behalf, urging me to do what I could to help him meet his financial obligations. I tried to explain that my father was a gambler who would throw whatever I gave him onto the gaming table. My friends argued that it was really immaterial how his financial obligations had been accrued; it was simply my duty to try to help. Besides, they reassured me, the poor old gentleman had publicly sworn off gambling.  Behind a smile, I clenched my teeth.  Not a word of protest escaped my lips, but neither did a copper escape my purse.After a week, my father begged enough money off of my friends to return home. Through my dirty windows, I watched him walk away, a slight limp noticeable in his gait. As I lost sight of his back, I wondered what our next meeting would bring. I think I might have rejoiced had I only known then that there wouldn't be another encounter. I would never see him again, either alive or dead.Two Skies                              vunterhThere was no other presence in the car.

7#$<L<0DWDWDWDWDWDefDDDDDDDE}xDE FJK*JuoDWJKF+ JKJKK,JKJKJKJKJKJKChapter 6: Deluge at the Beginning of NightAs I drove on in the waning hours of twilight, my eyes became blind in a sense to the highway that stretched ever westward in front of the hurtling metal cocoon of my car. My brain was arrested in some sort of stasis, and before my mind's eyes unfolded a scene almost as vivid as the physical world. I saw the old man strapped to his plane seat, asleep. But in the next moment, he cried out and awoke from a fitful rest."Sir," said an airline stewardess in a low voice. "It's alright." She gently laid a hand upon his shoulder."Ahh," he moaned."It's alright," she repeated soothingly. "Just a dream.""Are we flying?"She nodded. "It won't be long before you're home again.""Home again?" he muttered and turned his head slightly toward the young man in the seat next to his. The young man smiled politely before turning his attention back to the magazine in his hands. Looking again to the stewardess, the old man said, "My son. He brought me to the airport."The young man and the stewardess exchanged smiles and knowing glances. "Oh?" she said. "And does he live in New Orleans?""No," answered the old man, briefly unable to place his son's whereabouts. "He was ... on his way ... to ... California.... We were in New Orleans for vacation.""Really?" said the stewardess. "How nice. That must have been lots of fun. Would you care for something to drink?"The old man nodded. "Yes please.""And what would you like?""Orange juice.""I'll be right back with it. Before you even know I'm gone." She patted him on the shoulder a second time and raised herself up. The old man lifted his hand, and the stewardess knelt once more beside him. "Yes?" "It was my life. The past. I was remembering when I was a boy, when I left my father. It was a visit to my school, and he didn't stay very long. When he went away, I said goodbye....  That was ... over ... sixty years ago. We said goodbye." The old man looked forlornly at the stewardess. Smiling, she patted his hand. "That was a long time ago.""But it seemed like only the last second." The stewardess was so very young, without a crease or line or scar on her face. Not the slightest imperfection. The imperfections of time.She nodded again and after a moment longer said, "I'll get that juice for you." She stood up and walked away down the aisle.Glancing to his side, the old man saw his neighbor, reading his magazine. The old man turned away and pressed the side of his head into the small, soft pillow propped up against the firm headrest. As he shut his eyes, he sighed deeply. In his mind he saw his son racing through the desert. He watched me.The setting sun was a great fiery ball. Its rays fanned out beneath a cloudless twilight sky. A few wispy clouds high above the horizon were glazed tangerine orange. The constant drone of the car engine and the wind ceaselessly scraping the car's steel exterior surface filled my world, but my ears were deaf to sound. My thoughts fled in a new direction. I returned to my graduate student days, when casual conversations at dinner parties resulted in job offers from company presidents.  Whatever had been at work in Australia would come alive again in California. While formal interviews lack the spontaneity of dinner parties, I knew that I could bring to bear the element of surprise upon personnel officers poised on the defensive.I would be like the mounted Mongol army retreating before its enemies, drawing them away from stone battlements. The pursuers would follow onto unfamiliar ground, where I would wheel around to loose a shower of arrows singing through the wind, finding their targets, piercing the armors of doubt.  I would be a warrior for my own life. I would conquer the odds and claim a successful, perhaps significant career.After a time the last sliver of the red giant slipped beneath the earth's flat horizon, reluctantly relinquishing the evening to a wine dark sky.  My thoughts of glory faded too, eclipsed by yet another preoccupation. I looked down at the passenger's seat and my tapes and cassette player. Placing the tape player on my lap, I toyed with the idea of putting on the next installment of his narrative. My keen interest in his story was connected to a sense of guilt for having allowed my sense of justice to wane in the presence of a broken-hearted old man. I had nursed him like a child, but that didn't make him any less the villain, did it? I had nursed him, led him step by step away from the brink when grief alone might have swept him over the edge. And to what end? To insure that he lived out his allotment of years with what comfort he could find? Or to insure a stark survival, one in which he suffered, one in which he paid. My heart felt absolutely empty, like a dry hollow reed, like the cold limitless sky above the lifeless desert plain. "Mercy," I told myself, "would subvert the process. It would make a mockery of her suffering." But she no longer suffered. She no longer suffered.What happened to pain when no longer felt? When she who had felt it no longer lived? Did the pain really cease, or did it persist somewhere else like, say, ye olde parallel universe of my undergraduate fascination or, perhaps, somewhere not of the physical world, somewhere not of dimensionality but of memory? To be revived at a later date. To torment afresh the injured innocent party.In my mind I saw a magistrate, in his high-sheen robe of dark silk. He rose from his chair behind a dias of polished laquered wood.Before him, prostrate upon the stone floor of the court, was the accused. The old man who had killed his wife without ever laying a hand. The old man who had somehow strangled the mother of his children one cell at a time, corrupting her internal organs, poisoning the very womb through which she had brought new life into the world.Bracing his left hand upon the table, spreading apart his long fingers, the young magistrate yanked from a ceramic jar the bamboo strip that signified torture. He threw it clattering onto the floor, before the prisoner, whose forehead knocked against the granite surface as his body trembled terribly. The fingers of the accused were curled like bird's claws; his hands seemed to search the ground as if for an insect to eat, a discarded piece of loose change perhaps or a speck or strand of mercy. "No mercy," I heard the magistrate growl in a vibrant, unimpeachable voice. "Pain must be balanced by justice. The justice of the pain of the guilty party." Such an exacting set of scales. Such a tidy equation. But ultimately one naive and simplistic. For was there really any hope of striking a balance for the victim? There seemed to me but the weak potential for balance for those left behind in this sorry world.The officers of the court stepped forward. They raised their wooden staves. They brought those long, thick, heavy staves down against the ground, thundering approval of the magistrate's decision, thundering scorn and contempt at the culprit's wickedness, foretelling for him with utter clarity what was to follow.The criminal's fluffy white hair was raised from his head, as if stiffened while being brushed, as if materialized from streams of air like cotton candy. This milkweed floss began to vibrate, the pounding of the cudgels sending shocks of fear reverberating through the old man's bones. But despite this infestion of terror, this suffocation of rational thought, the grizzled old criminal was just self possessed enough to know not to beg for mercy. For what could possibly be gained? And what would lost? Just his remaining meager measure of self-respect and dignity.Soon, within the next few seconds, within the coming moment, those dense wooden staves would rise high again into the air in anticipation of the unprotected body, the soft flesh, the frail bones, the cracking of bones, the seeping out of marrow. Such was justice. The marrow of pain and justice.I drove straight into a wall of water; for me Houston will be forever a deluge. Jets of water thrown up by passing trucks knocked out one low beam headlight and then the other. I felt a trickle down my neck and switched on the cabin light.  Shooting a quick glance over my shoulder, I saw big water stains on the back passenger's seat. I switched on the high beams, pumped on the brakes and put the car into low gear.  Craning my neck, I took another look.  There was a puddle on the back seat floor.  My only copy of the thesis was partially submerged. "Fuck!"  How many weeks or months would it take me to reconstruct it a second time?  If the computer disks were damaged, I wouldn't be able to reconstruct it at all! Four years of work. Four long, lonely years of work. The blinding high-beam glare of a truck bearing down fast from the rear prompted me back into high speed and high gear.Somewhere between Houston and San Antonio the storm abated, but the storm within raged on.  I felt it was all my father's fault, that he was somehow to blame. But for what? For packing my thesis and computer disks in a vulnerable place? For making my car leak? For putting me in the position where I had to take to the road to find a place in lifeDanger, anger and a growing sense of uncertainty made my blood rise, made my nerves tingle, made me feel in a way urgently alive again, in a sense powerful if not in control. I decided against stopping for the night in San Antonio; a pressing sense of business or ... "procedure" urged me on. Unlike the storm, civilization was imperfect and biased; modern America in particular acquitted the guilty, absolved the barbarians. Thankfully, I was also Chinese, and Chinese have always known how to deal with barbarians. What was it like for the fugitive at this moment? Did the seconds pass like hours and the hours like days, leaving plenty of time for the past to hunt him down and exact revenge? My earlier concerns for his health were unfounded; Father's saga of a life had forged a man as durable as steel. He had years yet to live. So if not now then laterthe devils would catch him up. He was a fish swimming towards the fisherman's net, a fugitive fleeing towards the snares of his own guilt. A long night and interrogation lay ahead for the convict. A long, long night and trial for I the magistrate.The road and the rain went on and on.I set the court instrument with its coiled tape of evidence back on my lap and switched it on. My final exam scores were good, and in 1924 I graduated high school among the leaders of my class. I wasted little time in starting to look for a job since I didn't want to have to go home. I sat for the entrance exam of the provincial postal service and was soon rewarded with an appointment as the postmaster of Da Gu Xin Chang. Situated near the provincial border, salt from Sichuan province entered Guizhou through Da Gu Xin Chang, so its importance and wealth can be imagined. For basic training before assuming my post, I was sent to the city of Zun Yi.This happened also to be a purposeful community, bustling and full of activity. As for my training, it proved both tedious and trivial. So I applied myself as far as I could and spent the rest of my time on novels and the theater.Catercorner from my favorite drama house was a small restaurant where I took all my meals. The special arrangement I'd worked out with the proprietor allowed for as many bowls of rice and noodles breakfest, lunch and dinner as I wished. At twenty, I was possessed of an impressive appetite. The restaurant floor was caked with dirt, grease and spittle; its walls and ceiling coated with soot.  Even the tables were black, and only the tops of the wooden stools seemed clean, probably from the frequent application of patrons' asses.  I had picked this establishment because it seemed a cut above the norm.The proprietor, a short, round man with a shaved head, and his assistant, a boy only slightly younger than myself, were chatty fellows, but my usual preference was to eat in peace. I therefore sat content at my table as the owner and his boy carried on with jokes and songs in the kitchen, working their blackened woks over the leaping flames of the stoves. The front of the restaurant was open so that I could watch the streets and catch glimpses of local life.One day, I saw a beefy, middle-aged man rush into the nearby Catholic church. Despite the man's disheveled appearance, I instantly recognized him as the warlord Wong. How could I not when only a few weeks earlier he had extorted a substantial sum of silver from the Zun Yi post office? The Postmaster General in Beijing, a Frenchman, had sent an Italian named Abergetti to investigate, and Abergetti had gone straight to the warlord, demanding return of the loot plus penalty.  Wong had complied immediately, but this humiliating act of submission cost him dear. The prestige upon which his power was predicated eroded virtually overnight.  With the support of local bandits and business leaders, a rival named Zhou rose to prominence, and it was at the moment of my dinner that warlord Zhou's hunt for his predecessor came to an end at the Catholic church.Zhou and his men marched up to the church and pounded on its door. The French pastor came out. The new warlord demanded he hand over Wong.  The Frenchman responded by puffing out his chest and boldly proclaiming that his church was "a holy sanctuary!" Although his Chinese wasn't very good, I remember being amazed that the Frenchman could speak our language at all. I also thought about a little boy cousin of mine, who had died of fever when a French priest had refused to treat him as a non-Christian. Perhaps it would not have surprised me half as much if the Frenchman had frothed at the chops like a rabid wolf.The warlord shoved the pastor to the ground.  His soldier's rushed into the church and dragged out the squirming fugitive.  Wong was pushed to his knees, and Zhou himself drew a pistol. He pressed the nozzle against his rival's temple and pulled the trigger.I had seen plenty of corpses before; in fact, there was a field not far outside of Zun Yi that was littered with them. Beggars, debtors, criminals. Once I saw a tawny dog trotting down the middle of the road with a woman's hand in its mouth. The fingers and palm were a bit dirt-smudged but otherwise quite exquisite. She had probably been a whore. Although in years hence I have imagined her an imperial courtesan. Fat chance you'd find one of those in my neck of the woods.After a brief contemplation of his handiwork, Warlord Zhou gave fresh orders. Then as he strolled away, his men dragged the corpse into a nearby butcher's stall and slapped its head down on the log stump used as a chopping block.  One of the soldiers took hold of the butcher's ax and, in two strokes, hacked off the head at the neck. The other soldier picked up the grizzly trophy and held it out in front of him as the pair marched off, leaving the headless body sprawled limply beside the log, blood flowing out onto the street and soaking into the earth.  The French priest, still on his knees, gripped the sides of his head and babbled unintelligibly in his native tongue.Two Skies     vtrue ?

7#$h*R$\$\$\$\$\$j.$$$$$$$%Dx$% %***?O$\*% ***1******Chapter 7: The Dying CountryWe all knew why our country was the way it was. It was because of the foreigners.  The old emperors were right to forbid their entering our country, but who could curb their insatiable appetite for our silks, our porcelain and our tea?  We sold them all they wanted, yet they wanted not to have to pay. So to create a Chinese demand for Western goods, they pushed opium upon us, in vast quantities, against our wishes, in violation of our laws. The British from India and the Americans from Turkey. When we seized their opium and dumped it into the sea, the British sent a fleet to pound us into submission.  Then they demanded our gold and silver for their trouble.  The Americans joined in the chorus of demands, to 'protect' us from monopolistic exploitation, and the French soon followed suit. Such was the meaning of free commerce and fair trade among pirate nations.Our country was already sick and crippled before the coming of the foreigners.  The land belonged to the rich and the powerful; peasants owned little beyond their crushing obligation to pay taxes and serve in the labor brigades and armed forces of the tottering empire.  The nation of peasants rose up in arms, yet the foreigners could not tolerate the dynasty's demise. Their treaties of indemnity were with the Manchu Emperor; if the Qing Dynasty should fall to be replaced by a willful regime, how would they get their money? It would be like swapping the spineless warlord Wong for a tiger like Zhou! No, they really couldn't abandon the poor Manchus in their hour of need.  The foreigners supplied the Qing forces with better arms than the rebels could get and, on occasion, threw their own troops into the fight. All battles came to a similar conclusion.  The Nien rebellion in the North faltered; the Muslim uprisings in central and northwestern China failed. The Miao insurrection in my native Guizhou ended with the loss of one million souls, and the Muslim rebellion in neighboring Yunnan with five million. The blood of these millions  spilled onto the ground, flowed through the gutters of the streets, seeped into the furrows of the peasantss' fields planted with seed. The crop sowed and reaped was bloodier still. The peasant rebellion of the mighty, "heaven-sent" Taipings was crushed and pulverized like kernels of grain beneath the miller's massive stone wheel: twenty million dead.The long noses are not true human beings. Destruction is their primary product; death their primary crop. They know no remorse; they feel no shame. For them "compassion" is but a word, reserved for use in political subterfuge. They are moved by greed alone. The British blew up one of their own ships and accused us. A nameless French priest was murdered, and they pointed their pale fingers at us.  The British and French marched on Beijing and burnt to the ground the imperial summer palace.  Fresh demands for 'restitution' were heaped on top of the old ones; the Americans and Russians joined the free-for-all.  The foreign indemnity rose to many times the total wealth of the empire.The British took our client state Malaysia. The French went into Vietnam. We helped the Vietnamese beat them back, but despite their defeat on the battlefield, the French got the Manchus to cede control of the country.  The Qing government was weakness itself; their indemnity continued to multiple.  Japan, Germany, Portugal, Italy, Austro-Hungary, Belgium, Spain and Holland imposed their own conditions.  Completely unable to cope with the indemnity, the Manchus borrowed unimaginable sums from the very devils to whom they already owed an empire's ransom. After a time, they couldn't even hope to pay a fraction of the interest, so what choice but to start giving away bits and pieces of the country itself?The British took possession of the national customs service, and the French staked a claim to the postal service. The British quickly claimed exclusive rights to absolutely everything in the Yangtze Valley. They seized Weihai Bay naval base in Shandong province and enlarged their territories around Hong Kong. The French took Guangzhou Bay and asserted special rights in Guangdong, Yunnan and Guangxi provinces not to mention Hainan island. The Japanese took Fujian Province, then attacked our forces in Korea without bothering to declare war. The Germans occupied Qingdao island, and the Russians Port Arthur in Manchuria.  The Americans, delayed by their conquests of Hawaii and the Philippines, proclaimed the "Open Door Policy" to curb further partitioning until they were ready to join in the plunder. The Chinese provincial governor generals had initially raised troops to cope with bandits and suppress peasant uprisings. With the financial bankruptcy of the dynasty and the consequent collapse of central authority, they became independent warlords.  As such, they bled our poor, dying China through their endless petty but oh-so-bloody conflicts. Could they have bickered at all if not for the weapons supplied by the foreigners? They paid for this 'international aid' by surrendering regional sovereignty. The foreign market monopolies tightened.Automobiles, bicycles, nails, matches and seemingly everything else factory-manufactured became exclusive foreign concessions. While a peasant could grow tobacco and even dry and cut it, if he dared to roll it into cigarettes for sales this would violate treaty and land him in prison.  In actuality, the warlords were no less subjugated than the peasants. It was all they could do to beg alms at New Years from their foreign masters to offer local celebrations for appeasing the peasants.Imagine brigands who break into a house, beat the master and rape the mistress. They loot the house, leaving not so much as a shoe. Then, for sport, they chain the children and decorate them with a thousand delicate cuts. They skin the screaming children alive, one fleck of skin at a time. Wolves will fell a cow and rip open its throat, but what sort of monster is it that will not stop until it has individually violated and killed every cell of the victim's body?!Once again, we rose up, by the thousands, this time not to battle a prostrate dynasty but to root out the odious, polluted cancer, these snouty devils that were flaying our motherland!Only, the devils were hard to get at, barricaded in their legations, protected by their guns.  We slaughtered their lackeys, the Christian Chinese, by the thousands, but what good was that? Wild with hatred, crazed by desperation, we charged their legation barricades with wicker shields and piled high our bodies into ramps of flesh, all to get at them, to satisfy and quench the thirst of our steel blades for their watery blood, to splatter with their own warm liquid vermillion the pristine white floor stones of their despised mansions.  An army of eight Western nations stormed Beijing and mowed us down with fire power, like a lawn mower cutting the overgrown grass in one of these American yards in summer. Oh yes, I knew all about the long noses, for my uncle had seen to my education. Personal experience at Zun Yi simply affirmed my basis for hatred. The murder of the fallen warlord horrified me, but it also filled me with a sublime awe and joy!  Just as vividly as the blood, I remember the arrogant little bastard priest, brushed aside like a pesky mosquito. It pleased me to no end that I shared a surname with the Warlord Zhou, who could humble a Frenchman.Two Skies     vinto the furrows of the peasant`8bmW:|c(A88`H`(A(@,@8`H,(@8`KQ`8~9HA8`H8!@|N 88c8(@8dN 88(@N 888H,(@8H4@N 4@N 8c8H(@8`N |(@A|ePN 8cT>H|@@N (@(M "#$RSTbcdghm@P@#$9p"Q>)Sdefgh&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@g@hg@kPPU/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH@Rd(hh@d'=/B@H-:StyleWriter IIFNew YorkGenevaMonacoPalatinoTimesHelveticaCourierSymbolMishawakaMishawaka BoldUTrebuchet MSArialCharcoalCapitalsSandCourier NewTechnoMonotype SortsTimes New RomanWingdingsHoefler TextHoefler Text OrnamentsImpactSkiaTextileGadgetApple ChanceryMT ExtraComic Sans MS/BrushScrDKBalloonDExtBoliCooperBlaDDomCasualDRegParkAveDAndale Mono#VerdanaBernhardFasDURWImperialTRegEurostileTBlaExtURWBodoniTReg MicrogrammaDMedExt CNevisonCasD ENicolasCocTReg OkayD OldEnglishD!PlaybillD!SpringfieldD"VAGRundschriftD"WindsorDReg$*BrodyJoiD$6HogarthScrJoiD$BVladimirScrJoiD%Missy BT%Liorah BT%Ryan BT%Hank BT%Melanie BT/-Arial Black/Georgia6ArabBruD7Webdings7BlacklightD9ChesterfieldAntD9GilliesAntDBol:DLegerD:eColumnaSolSCD:GoudySwaTLigIta:CoronetI?ChicagoVT100xxxL,lBLYxQRfgmySg1CH24Desktop PublishingDesktop Publishing

7##*"(W(W(W(W(W(e<((((((()Mx() )*.**X(W*.)0*.*.*X-*.*.*.*.*.*.Chapter 8: The CureThe old Chinese postmaster of Zun Yi was dismissed, and Abergetti assumed his post on a permanent basis. While the old postmaster had come to work every morning on a sedan chair that was carried right into the building, Abergettishort, stocky and dark-complexionedwalked to work and carried the mailbags along with the rest of us. It's quite possible that I resented him even more than the priest, for you see, I couldn't suppress a sneaking admiration. After a few months, Postmaster Abergetti pronounced me fit for my own "command".  Unfortunately, I happened to be in the grips of diarrhea, probably due to food poisoning. Hardly surprising given the place where I ate. My immediate Chinese supervisor, a Mr. Wong, advised me to wait a couple of weeks before setting out for Da Gu Xin Chang. Afterall, the trip would be long and arduous. But I had had my fill of Zun Yi and was impatient to begin my career. I assured Mr. Wong that my physical constitution would be equal to whatever the road had to offer. Unable to dissuade me, he reported my condition and intentions to Abergetti, who wasted no time in engaging two sedan chair carriers for the journey and insisting I use them. On the appointed day, I briskly marched out of town, the spurned sedan carriers trailing behind me at a short distance.  Before evening though, I was riding the sedan lying on my side and coiled into a ball.The innkeeper at that first night's stop concocted a thick "medicinal" broth, which mainly consisted of black pepper and brown sugar. I forced this hot mixture down my throat, and when I awoke the next morning, my stomach pains were a thing of the past. I felt absolutely spry.  I thanked the innkeeper and ordered for the sedan carriers and myself a full breakfast of rice gruel, spiced cabbage, salted peanuts and fried bean curd. We went on, my brother sedan carriers and I, knocking off thirty li at a stretch, treating our fit threesome to a hearty snack or full meal at every stop! But by the end of the day, I was in the sedan chair again, my hand dangling over the side. That evening, one of the sedan carriers fetched an apothecary."What's wrong with me?" I asked him.  "You're constipated," he answered."Obviously," I said. "But why?"The old man smiled. "It's the pepper and sugar paste. That stopped your diarrhea alright, but it also plugged you up. Plugged you right up. See? Not a very effective cure if you ask me." The apothecary derived from his own witless commentary an inappopriately long chuckle. "It's a good thing you knew enough to stop stuffing yourself when you did.  Another bowl of rice, and you might have burst your guts!" He tapped my belly with a finger. "Tight as an overripe watermelon."The apothecary went back to his shop and returned with a glass vial with a foreign label. "Here's a panacea that will mend a thousand ills," he said. "All the way from Germany."Imported. It was a good sign.He unplugged the vial and tilted it over his palm.  Out rolled a dozen or so tiny black pills, like aniseed. "Take them. Right away.""All of them?""All of them."With trepidation, I received the seedlike pills into my hands and licked them into my mouth. Then I thanked the apothecary and apologized for the inconvenience. Soon thereafter, I fell asleep.Not half an hour later, I awoke with a start. There was a comotion in my stomach; the rumbling aroused my mates."Great Heavens," I shouted. "Poisoned. I've been poisoned. That old sack's gone and poisoned me!""No, Master," contradicted one of the sedan carriers. "It's the cure."I rushed to the out house and just managed to pull down my trousers before the first eruption. The ... ahem 'activity' continued for some time.... By the morning, my bowels were clear, and we celebrated with a feast of piping hot soy bean milk and deep-fried pastry strips. I sent a man to invite the wise apothecary, but apparently, he wasn't in a humor for socializing. Instead, he sent the small glass vial of black German pills, which I gladly tucked into my breast pocket.Immediately after breakfast, we set off again.  However, it wasn't many li before I was doubled over once more. The diarrhea had returned with a vengeance. In frustration, I grabbed my hair, and to my utter amazement and extreme anguish, a great tuft of it pulled out in my balled fist!My frequent stops reduced us to a crawl, so in the evening, we cooked a second broth of pepper and sugar.  This checked my diarrhea until the following night, when constipation made me resort a second time to the black pills. A day later, it was back to the broth; the night after that, the little pills.  On the afternoon of the seventh day, our journey finally came to an end when we arrived in Da Gu Xin Chang. But by this point, I was a lump of flesh in the sedan chair with hardly the strength to stir."We sought medical attention at every turn," explained one of the sedan carriers to the city magistrate, to whom I was delivered. "All told," he said, "there must have been four or five different doctors.""Well," said the magistrate, "somebody's got to know how to deal with this." Immediately, he sent out runners to summon all of the city's most esteemed physicians. Another week of remedies similar to those already administered brought me to the brink of death. I was now completely paralyzed and barely conscious when I was conscious at all. I was placed on a cot in the center of a room.  Pillows propped me on my side, and a metal basin was set beneath my bare buttocks to catch the brown dribble of my liquid waste. Servants came periodically to wipe me off or change the basin; my blunted senses spared me the stinch.  Beneath my filthy clothes I was truly naked, for I had lost every last strand of hair on my body. Sometimes I saw dark forms moving before me; the servants no doubt, but I took them for spirits. Indeed, my one foot was already on the other side. I heard the muffled sound of hammering and knew without being told that it was my coffin being built.  At this late juncture, the magistrate approached a local schoolmaster who had a certain reputation as a healer.  After listening to my case, the teacher commended the magistrate on his foresight concerning funeral preparations.  With a bit of persuasion, however, he consented to a last-resort house call.Few people came close to me now, and nobody seemed to touch me except to wipe me off. So I still remember clearly the great shadow that washed over me and applied soft pressure to points in my head, neck, wrists and body: the taking of vital signs.  His diagnosis done, the teacher confirmed that I was doomed. However ...  and this "however" was the only fine thin thread still holding me to this life ... there was always opium, which was known for the odd miracle.  Of course, even if the narcotic did by chance save me, it would also claim me for an addict. And if I was a young man of ambitions, it might be just as well to let me slip away now rather than condemn me to a lifetime of drug bondage.Any treatment at all was more than the magistrate had hoped for. Besides, weren't there local officials and businessmen a plenty who were opium eaters themselves? Why was the good schoolmaster so pessimistic. This particular social habit, assuming that I survived at all, would positively be a professional asset!  The good schoolmaster was urged to try. I am told that at this point the schoolmaster drew from an inner pocket of his long cotton gown a small paper envelope, which he carefully unfolded to reveal several snow white beadlike pellets.  He sent for a water pipe. When it arrived, he planted one of the round pellets in the ash and residue of the water pipe's bowl.  A slender coil of paper was dipped into a lamp, and the tiny precarious flame of the paper torch was held to the pellet until it began to glow red.The pipe was passed to a manservant. The manservant put the mouthpiece to his lips and filled his cheeks with smoke.  He knelt down before me while two other manservants pinched my nose and pried open my mouth.  Sealing his lips against mine, the manservant blew into my mouth, blew into it as though to inflate a balloon. Opium smoke went down my windpipe; opium smoke went into my lungs.The first lung full of smoke had no effect.  The second lung full as well. The third lung full, however, caused one eye to open a sliver. My fingers began to stir. My stomach began to gurgle.  After a time, I was fed a few spoonfuls of broth. After that, I was allowed to sleep.When I awoke the next afternoon, I was fed more opium smoke and a small bowl of rice gruel. In three days' time, I was sitting up in bed and smoking opium for myself. By the end of the week, I was walking in my room.  Within a month, I was completely recovered.Two Skies     vH`|x(@8`H 888xH8!@|N |/2#######@P@7xw-=q!q""#4#i#####&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@,"#`"@PQ@P##U/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH@R(HH@H @@'=/B@H-:StyleWriter IINew YorkGenevaTimesCourierr/M-\Desktop PublishingDesktop Publishing

7#18`06 6 6 6 6 6.J6x6x6x66667$x6x7 78*8/6 870888/1888888Chapter 9: A Post Master's LifeLife as the postmaster of Da Gu Xin Chang was what I made of it. I could work as little as I wanted and postal service would continue through the function of my subordinates.  To keep myself amused, I created projects to improve our service.In the mornings I worked steadily until my energy drained into opium craving. Then I lay down on a bed in my inner office to take a mid-day pipe at leisure. When I rose again in the afternoon, I was invariably ...  refreshed.  My mind became a whirlwind; my body an engine running at full bore. Meeting with business associates, I could interpret every nuance of their expressions; I could read practically their very thoughts in their heads. T'was the miracle of the drug.In the evenings, there were dinner parties where the city government's chief executives fraternized with one another and dallied with "rented wives".  At first, the white liquor that flowed freely at these events was almost as great a novelty to me as opium had been, but the liquor quickly lost its fiery potency. The young ladies, on the other hand, were another matter. Before my eyes were women who would willingly drape themselves around me for compensation that amounted to a fraction of my wages."You're a nice-looking young chap," said the burly police chief to me early one morning as we sat together at an abandoned mahjong table after the conclusion of an all-night game. "It's a waste of your youth going back alone to that cell of yours. You're living like a monk." He nodded in the direction of a slim young girl halfway across the crowded parlor. She sat on the lap of the reedy, grey-haired telegraph master, who was engrossed in conversation with a group of cronies.  "How would you like to kneel down with that devout nun?"I turned to him without even the worldliness to hide my blush. The girl was indeed exquisite. Her eyes were lazy and unfathomable. Her full lips were set in a perpetual pout. She ran her delicate hand down the sleek skin of her shiny silk dress, and my eyes continued the sweep along her hip and across her thigh.I was as yet an innocent young man. Incredibly innocent. That is to say, I had not had any experience of women. Nor had I read any manuals on the subject. I could but form vague pictures in my mind of what I might actually do with the kitten, pictures that, nonetheless, caused my blood to rise, as though part of my stomach were rising up into my chest. My penis hardened, pressing against my trousers like a tent pole against a tent, but more importantly, it pressed against my sense of propriety and decency and shame. I could no longer rise to leave the mahjong table even if I wanted to."She likes you," offered the police chief lasciviously. "The way she's moving under your gaze."The notion seemed absurd given my hideous appearance. The lonely hairs on my ravaged head could be counted, and I had no eye brows. Who could imagine a less appetizing prospect for any attractive young woman? If only at that moment I had opium smoke in my lungs and an opium eye in the middle my forehead, that is to say opium's lucidity with which to interpret the police chief's ulterior motives.My smirking companion nudged me with a pudgy hand. And I responded by saying, by almost lamenting, "But she's Mr. Wang's consort." The police chief looked at me closely. As though he were examining a particularly flawed piece of jade. He guffawed, "Mr. Wang's wife is tiring of the extra expense. She's tightening the purse strings. It won't be long now. Just you wait. In another few weeks, the girl will be cut loose and in search of a new man." The police chief nudged me again, harder than before, making me list to one side, a frail and tiny ship being challenged by stiff winds. "Aren't you interested?  Why, look at her. She's a regular peach."From the jumble of rectangular mahjong pieces strewn across the table, I picked one up at random and began rotating it, twirling it in my fingers for something to do, for something upon which to focus and concentrate the mind, for something trivial but just complex and involved enough to show the police chief that here was one not so easily mesmerized. The snake trying to charm the charmer. "Won't Mr. Wang object?" The police chief shut his eyes and shook his head. "Do you suppose that Mr. Wang wants to see the girl unemployed? Without food, without clothing, without shelter? He may well 'drink a bit of vinegar' at the thought of her with someone else, but I assure you, the man's also not without pity.  Jealousy aside, our telegraph master is a practical soul.""If she's such a peach," I said, tapping the cool mahjong piece against the table, making like a high and mighty magistrate with his gavel block, "why don't you want her for yourself?"My companion started laughing, so hard, in fact, that his shoulders quaked. "I've got enough troubles with the one I already have." He slapped my back.  "As it is, I've got to lock her clothes away just to keep her from going out on the prowl when I'm not around, scratching around for the likes of you.""You lock her clothes away? You mean you keep her ... naked?""Without a stitch.""Doesn't she catch cold?"The police chief rubbed his bulging belly. " Now don't you fret, young postmaster; on chilly nights I provide an ample blanket."That day, I walked home under a cloud of confusion and almost physically pained by embarrassment but nevertheless still with the pouting girl squarely before my eyes. I saw her as I undressed. I saw her as I climbed onto my cot. I saw her as I lay there unable to sleep, the sunlight streaming in through the window by my desk. I saw her as I got up again and prepared my morning pipe. I saw her as I set a flame to the little white pellet and watched it begin to glow red.  Could it be that the police chief was trying to trick the repulsive boy postmaster into a dispute with a city elder?  Or was he merely having me on for a bit of personal fun and entertainment? Uncertainty lifted only when my lungs filled with smoke. The narcotic offered the type of light that the sun could not, one into my own dark tunnel so that I could find my way out again.  Several weeks later, when Mr. Wang released his pretty young concubine, I made no bid for her business.By the measure of the community or even my accomplished family, I was a success. Mine was a secure position with authority and privilege, and all that seemed left to be done was to find a suitable match. Letters from Grandmother Man Niang obsessed on this issue; she wrote often and at length of the various prospects she had interviewed. Through my own eyes, however, life seemed practically over before it had really even begun. "In Wuhan," lectured the schoolmaster who had saved my life, "an imperial army sergeant leads his garrison in mutiny, and the spontaneous uprisings that flare across the country finally put a decrepit dynasty out of its misery." It was early evening, and the two of us were tramping up and down the deserted streets of Da Gu Xin Chang. Our hands were curled up in our jacket sleeves against the late autumn chill. I even tried curling my toes inside my shoes, but this caused some pain in walking. The two of us puffed faint clouds just as if we were sharing a pipe. The schoolmaster, a tall lean man with chiseled features, continued in his usual patient, measured cadence, "General Yuan Shi-kai enthrones himself as new emperor, but when three of our Southwestern warlords march on Beijing, he dies of heart attack. Not to wish ill of any man, but for the sake of the country, what could be better?"  "Luckier still," I offered through chattering teeth, "the war breaks out in Europe, and the long noses take to fighting each other. No time and troops to waste on us.""Yes," said the school master with a noticeable lilt in his voice. "Just so. A keen observation. Well noted. By the way ... how's that ginger paste working out?" He stopped me in mid-stride and, squinting, bent me over so that he could get a look at my scalp and feel around it a bit with the tips of his fingers. "Hold on there," he lowed, as if he were a large animal veternarian talking to a flighty horse.  I bent over lower to facilitate this examination by moonlight.I said, "It tingles. The paste that is. At the roots of the hair." "Good," mumbled Master Ho, and he started to apply greater force with his fingers, almost kneading my head like a lump of resistent dough. I doubt that he noticed, but I grimaced and set my jaws. "Mm hm. Gooood.... And when ... the Europeans finish slaughtering each other ... what does the American president declare?""A new dawn," I recited through grit teeth.  "One of justice, respect and self-determination for all the world's people."Patting me on the side of an arm, he said softly, "Get up. Your head is budding brilliantly. Before you know it, there'll will be a jungle up there."I ran a hand over my prickly and smarting scalp. "Thank you." The schoolmaster had shrewd, penetrating eyes.  He narrowed those eyes at my earlier remark and said in a sardonic voice, "Don't thank me. Thank President Wilson." In apparent contradiction to the gravity of his tone, the man started to chuckle. He marched on, and I had to skip to catch up. We took a turn at the corner and started down a narrow lane, bringing us almost claustrophobically close to the houses on either side. At every house the light within showed through the cracks beneath the doors and glowed through the sheets of paper pasted over the window frames. A few windows sported the grey silhouettes of paper cutsbaskets of flowers and groves of bamboo, fat lounging water buffalo and tall stately pagodas. Coal smoke scented the air. "'New dawn'?" he resumed contemptuously and actually spat on the ground. "All that occurred here was that Germany's territory was transferred to the Japanese!"Despite the years the man had on me, perhaps decades, I was all of a sudden struggling to simply keep apace. "I tell you," he hissed, "the real dawn is in Russia. Her people think in a new and different way."I nodded at the notion. "Suppose it's possible."Immediately, the schoolmaster pulled me to a halt. He turned me like a father his small child to face him. Pressing a finger into my chest, he said, "What other Western power has rescinded its claim on our country, actually returned stolen territory?"I admitted, "No other.""Russia," he annunciated very carefully, out of a very evident respect for the nation, "treats China as an equal. They can't all devils, you know." With all my heart, I so wanted to believe. The man had saved my life. He had proved himself both wise and good. I longed to join the Nationalists and Communists in the South, who were learning the new thinking from the Russians. And with even more than all my heart ... I was ashamed to admit that I also wanted to witness the outside world and all its unearthly wonders. I was in my early twenties and had yet to see even a wheeled vehicle; in mountainous Guizhou, we relied on mules for cargo and peasants for sedan chairs. I said to my teacher, "Tell me about the self-propelled carriages. The Russians ride in them too, don't they? Just like the English and Germans? I mean, such machines would constitute manifestations of the superiority of socialism, wouldn't they?""All the Western nations have automobiles.""Yes,"I stammered. "But perhaps the Russian ones are better in some way. Maybe they're bigger. Maybe they're faster. Tell me about the machines that fly high in the sky and faster than eagles. The Russian ones that is."The school master bowed his head and shook it. He chuckled into his hand at my young man's utter transparency.  "The twentieth century," quietly said my mentor. "That's what really fascinates you, isn't it?""Revolution ," I fervantly countered, "is the object of my mind and the indisputable object of my heart.""Come along, Revolutionary," said Master Ho. "To my house for tea, and I'll regale you with all the stories you can take, like mooncakes for the boy starved of sweets."With that he doubled his pace. I jogged along so as not to be left behind in the silent sixteenth century streets.Two Skies     vW|#xx=xC|#}|||!N |!|x|#x|+xW8|c|@@8W8|W~|H(8x8@K/I`xK]%&'(}(~((((//111111111$@P@&'E K`{s!!##$$X'J'(Z(()**,--.//0111111&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@=01`Y)0@;P@PS@1$1U/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH@Rd(hh@d'=/B@H-:StyleWriter IINew YorkGenevaTimesCourierEMBE0p1CH22Desktop PublishingDesktop Publishing

7#$_u_f\f\lllllllllllmrxlm nr@*rj[lr@n  r@r@u2r@r@r@r@r@r@Chapter 10: A Rare GirlMaster Ho came to introduce me to another educated young man, who worked as a teacher for the children of several prominent local merchant families. Although we enjoyed an instant rapport, we never had a chance to develop friendship.  His family lived many days journey away, so when his wife fell ill, he quit his job to return home. Desperate for some small sense of purpose, I took over his class.The single-room former warehouse that we used as a school building belonged to the father of one of the students and occupied an obscure location in the western end of town. The building was modest in size, about as large perhaps as a two or three car garage. It had a single window, which was curiously tiny, probably to thwart attempted break ins. The window was also covered with actual glass, a rarity indeed for that part of the world at that time. And the floor was made of rough wooden boards. All told, the building was rather European in design and created for occupants a strange and somber atmosphere. Nevertheless, on that first day of class it was for me as well as perhaps for the students too a rather exciting venue. I walked over the dusty, creaky floor boards with a real bounce to my step. The class consisted of twelve boys, who sat at small desks before my table, and five girls, who stayed behind a pair of drawn curtains that divided the warehouse.  During English recitation, the boys all but drowned out the girls, and during questions and answers, the boys raised their hands while the girls called out, "Teacher Zhou," from behind their curtain. Needless to say, I quickly learned the faces of the boys and the voices of the girls. Within a couple of nights I also learned that without exception my students were respectful and diligent. I learned that the boys, without exception, were bound to follow in their fathers' footsteps as merchants. Education was meant to give them an edge in business, especially when dealing with the shrewd and wily traders from Sichuan. Nothing more. The girls, whose marriage contracts had long since been settled, were fated for ornamental lives.  With their bound feet, they might never do any menial work beyond stitchery; they could only act as living mannequins for the silks and jewels of their husbands.  Why the parents wanted to give them an education, I did not know. Besides English, I taught mathematics and classical Chinese. I discovered that while most of the boys were competent writers a few of the girls were excellent writers. There was one girl in particular whose eloquence absolutely proclaimed itself.Her name was Lan En-zhang, the top girl in all subjects and elder sister to the top boy. Even if she never signed her work, I would have recognized it from the balance of the brush strokes and bold sentiment of the prose. She didn't debate a woman's right to study the classics and modern science, she demanded it. Were the girls here in attendance in my little academy because of her staunch advocacy? Lan En-zhang didn't fret over bound feet, which tethered her to beds and sedan chairs, she cursed them. She longed to be able to sally forth, of her own volition, not just from her room, from her courtyard, from her estate but from this city and province. The girl yearned to see the world. It was as though freedom from pain and tradition might automatically transport her to the broad avenues of imperial Beijing or possibly Paris, London and Berlin. Lan En-zhang's words made her seem tall in my mind. But preferably no taller than me. I pictured a face with slightly raised cheeks and exquisitely shaped eyes, piercing and hawklike in their focus. I saw skin so fair and fine that it conjured images of the flesh of ripe pears. I admired small, delicate hands, with slender fingers that moved slowly and gracefully through the air as though strumming invisible lute strings as yielding as daffodil fluff. I marveled at a rare and intimidating beauty, one who would only ever surrender her affections to the right man. Lan En-zhang's passion seemed to glow hotter than the red iron in a smithie's tongs, and in her presence, my own burning determination to escape our mountain prison (and cradle) began actually to cool.One evening in mid-December, during our customary recess mid-way through evening lessons, I sat at my desk trying to generate fresh geometry problems for the second half of class. Except for me, the room was empty, or so I assumed until I heard a noise from behind the curtain.I said, "Who is it?"There came no reply. I put down my pencil and wiggled my fingers, stiff with cold despite the significant amount of heat radiating from the coal burner in the corner of the room closest to my desk. I repeated, "Who is it?"Again, silence. Easing myself up from the chair, I stepped out from behind the table. I crept and creaked my way down a narrow aisle between two files of squat wooden desks to the part in the thick curtains.  Slowly, I pulled back a heavy flap, and the once-hidden desks came into view.  I drew the curtain back further still and leaned through the opening to where the air was distinctly colder.  Turning my head to one side, I found a pair of large, brown doe eyes staring back at me across the distance of but a few paces. "You are ...?" The girl dropped her gaze and answered, "Lan En-zhang."A relatively wide forehead tapered to a round chin. The lips were neither too full or too thin. The nose was prominent but not excessive. The complexion was as fair as expectation. I studied her for only a moment, yet in my mind registered countless details of her image. There were the individual strands of her hair, the individual strands of her curvy eyelashes. I remembered seeing the soft wet pinkness of her tongue and its multitude of tiny taste buds. The blush of her somewhat shallow checks struck me as more beautiful than the blush of the twilight sky; her facial coloring gradually muted radially outward like fine pigment bleeding in water-saturated paper. The irises of her eyes were a lighter brown than normal for a Chinese, almost amber. They appeared ribbed or striated; they looked pedaled like the corona of a flower, making her black pupils the heart of the flower. Her hair was braided in one long, thick ponytail. From the base of the ponytail her slim elegant neck sloped smoothly down to beneath the high collar of her padded quilt jacket. My nostrils detected the scent of her skin, a scent as distinct as that of an infant yet like nothing I had ever known before. A scent heady and exhilarating and intoxicating. I imagined that I could even distinguish the scent of her breath, which was subtle and sweet like that of mooncake not too long emerged from the oven, still throwing off a delicious warmth. I felt overwhelmed in the presence of this girl; the experience seemed extraordinary, as if I had not seen another human being in a hundred years. I was not at a loss for words or actions; I was simply lost in the sight of her. But then with time, no longer than a second or two I'm sure, my senses returned to me, or was it I to them?With a contrived, knowing nod, I said, "Lan En-zhang.... Yes ....I guessed so much." The girl did not look up. She said, "Teacher, I'm sorry for not having answered when you first called out." I reassured her, "No matter," this time contritely. "Maybe you were caught off guard. Or maybe ... you simply wanted to be by yourself."She bit down on her lower lip, and I struggled to find the words to put her at ease.Suddenly, she raised her head and looked me in the eyes again. She asked, "Is it true?""Is what true?"The flower blossom lioness took a step forward and I a step back. "Is what Zhou Guang-yu says true?" she asked, the fog of her bewitching breath lingering in the air. "Has the telegraph master made her father an offer?""An offer?" I asked stupidly. "An offer for what? Who's Zhou Guang-yu?"She knit her brows and opened her mouth but could not seem to find voice. Brushing her focus over the top of the paper strewn desk that lay between us, she finally said, "I thought you must have known. Please excuse my presumption. Zhou Guang-yu is nobody with whom to concern yourself.""She's obviously a friend of yours. How old is she?""Fourteen."Fourteen. Ahhh. Anything having to do with the telegraph master and a fourteen year old girl was highly unlikely to be savory and wholesome. I pressed for details. "Zhou Guang-yu's father is a cobbler," explained my pupil, "and sometimes when he comes to our house with shoes for my parents, he brings along his daughter." The rest could have been guessed. The old cobbler had made the mistake of taking his daughter on a delivery run to the telegraph master's house, and the old lecher had quickly determined that he must have the girl along with his new shoes. Right there and then he had made an offer of purchase for the child, using his every advantage to leverage the poor father's decision in his own favor."As we both know," uttered Lan En-zhang in a small, weary voice, "the girl is from the working class. Far beneath our sensibilities. You needn't trouble yourself over her account. I must learn to put my feelings into proper perspective."This girl in front of me was not the creature of my fantasies. She was, perhaps, in the classical sense at least, not as stunning and lovely. But in a comprehensive, larger sense, she was so much more than fantasy; she was a young woman of substance, a person soft-spoken but steely, a soul mature beyond her years, mature beyond my years.  Standing there before this slight girl, it struck me that it was I who was the pupil and she the teacher."No," I hastened to say. "No," I rushed to make her understand. My perspective was in all likelihood very similar to if not exactly the same as hers.The approach of voices cut short my attempt at explanation; the rest of the students were returning from recess. Without another word, I quickly withdrew to the boys' portion of the school house and retreated to my table. The boys came in through the front door. A few seconds later I heard the girls entering through the rear door.The next day, I sent word to Telegraph Master Wang that the "Zhou" of the cobbler's family was the same "Zhou" of my family, implying that here was a humble branch of an illustrious house. His little game came to an abrupt end. That evening, I paid a visit to the cobbler and requested the regular company of his daughter, not as a concubine but as a student, free of charge. To this, the non-plussed but grateful parent readily consented.Many weeks later, I recessed my night school for Spring Festival. Master Ho and the parents of my students vied for my attendance at their family gatherings. My mock cousins the Zhou's went so far as to throw a banquet expressly in my honor.At the Lan family gathering, the boys ate with the men in the main hall while the girls ate with the women separately. I saw Lan En-zhang but once and accidentally. Master Ho and I were in one of the estate courtyards admiring its garden, aesthetic and pleasant even in winter, when I looked up to catch her standing by the circular portal in the wall of Master Lan's library. She wore a padded violet silk jacket with fur trim and matching padded trousers. Her hair was braided as before. She watched me watching her and, positively beaming, held my eyes until my companion, totally unaware, pulled me away to rejoin the other men for mahjong.The festivities dragged on, but I endured. Happily, they came to an end after a couple more weeks. On the first day back at work, I fretted away the hours until the evening's tutorial. But finally that arrived as well.The first half of class passed excruciatingly slowly, second by second, as I sat behind my table listening to English recitations that threatened to go on forever. After half an hour, I called break early, and while my somewhat bewildered boy pupils filed past me out the door, I studiously pretended to read students' compositions. Once their voices receded slightly and the sound of the girls exiting the rear door had faded too, I flew to the partition in the curtains and bolted through, only to discover that I had mistaken a crease for the part. I thrashed about in the fabric's close embrace, keenly aware of my very limited time. Lan En-zhang's curtain-muffled laughter brought a hot blush to my face. I disentangled myself and clumsily searched out the part in the curtains with my hands. Stepping through, I found Lan En-zhang standing on the other side, waiting for me. Waiting for me. The clown."Did you have a good time at my house?" she asked."Of course," I answered. "And you?""My friend Zhou Guang-yu," she said, her smile immediately faltering. "She's very beautiful, is she not?"My star pupil wore a blouse and pants of blue cotton and diminutive shoes of black. Her plain attire seemed more fetching, more becoming, more complimentary than the rich silks of Spring Festival. Be that as it may, there seemed no disputing that purely in terms of physical beauty most people would rate her below Zhou Guang-yu of the large, round eyes and perfect melon seed face. Precisely because of this, I found her self-consciousness touching: this girl of wealth and privilege was at the disadvantage. And she cared enough about me that it mattered what I thought.  This young man, usually clay tongued, terribly self-conscious with the opposite gender, the epitome of awkwardness, for once had no trouble expressing his feelings. I said, "In my opinion Miss Zhou is not nearly so beautiful as her friend. The guardian angel."My angel's smile revived, and in her joy, there seemed a revival of spring colors over the barren landscape of my heart and the dance of butterflies among the blossoms of silly hope. I seemed to hear the sighing of bamboo, swaying in a warm breeze, and the chirp of the crickets in the evening of perfect contentment. Words failed me. Words failed her too. Words for the pair of us had suddenly become obsolete. I looked at her as she looked at the ground and basked in my gaze. A gaze possibly worth more to her than all the brocade silk in the province of Guizhou. How had I come to acquire such immense wealth? Just as abruptly as it had come upon us, the moment seemed to pass. Summer glory reverted to winter gloom as Lan En-zhang's smile curdled into an unmistakable frown. I urgently asked, "What is it?" She shook her head. She knit her brows. She pursed her lips, as though unwilling to speak, as though resisting having to take a spoonful of bitter medicene. She shook her head again. She said, "You should not have intervened.""Why? Zhou Guang-yu is a friend of yours. And ... and ... she is now a student of mine. I value her. I treasure her. I'm glad for what I did. Glad."Lan En-Zhang whispered, "Because," not looking down at the impenetrable ground so much perhaps as trying somehow to thread her line of sight through the impossible tight weave of a tarp, "you are now in some danger." I simply looked at her, dumbfounded, not at all sure that I had heard correctly. After some seconds I managed the single word "Danger?"Lan En-zhang bit down on her lower lip, bit down so hard that the lip blanched, and I feared that she would draw blood. Outside, I could already hear the animated voices of my students."Danger?" I repeated. "How so? How is it possible? What are you talking about? Tell me. Tell me."She raised her head, trying to look at me again but unable to. "The telegraph master ...," she said in a low voice, almost a whisper, "he ... he...."The chatter of the students grew louder. I looked back over my shoulder at the curtains."And the police chief, the telegraph master's friend. The two of them. They have it in for you."I said, "I don't understand," stepping backwards towards the curtain, pulled away by the force of those approaching voices, drawn back towards the shadow-striped curtains like a ghost frightened by the coming dawn. "How can you know this?"Before she could answer, footsteps at the door drove me scurrying back to the other side of the divide, seemingly from the bright realm of life to the nether world of confusion and isolation.The very next day, I enlisted the help of schoolmaster Ho. He, in turn, recruited the o ne of his adult sons who enjoyed a reputation as a great carouser. During the course of a few evening debauches, Master Ho the younger was able not only to confirm what I had inferred from Lan En-zhang's hint but to ascertain the time and place of a planned attack on my person. After that, it was a simple matter of arming my brawniest mail sack carriers with pine cudgels and having them follow within earshot as I sauntered through the district, to give the thugs plenty of time to pick up my trail, and wandered through a few back alleys, the ideal setting for ambush. Needless to say, our ambush worked to perfection as my men rushed to the rescue within seconds after two of the police chief's henchmen stepped out of the shadows. My men beat the thugs to a bloody pulp and carried them to the police station, where they were dumped unceremoniously at the feet of the flabbergasted constable."What's the meaning of this?" blathered the bear-like man. "Did they try to rob the post office?" "No," I said. "They tried to execute your orders.""Execute my orders?" cried the lout with feigned ignorance. "And what orders might these have been?"This nineteen year old postmaster walked boldly to the police chief's desk and assumed the seat of authority.  "Were you aware that I address the provincial police commissioner Zhou Ai-wu as 'Uncle'?"The police chief's eyes narrowed. He looked about at my toughs, who blocked every possible route of escape. He turned back to me and nodded with a smirk. He said, "It would seem that the house of Zhou is quite the extended family. Counting among its members not only a lowly cobbler but our exulted provincial police chief too. Well, I'll be."Like a magistrate intent upon interrogation, I pointed a waging forefinger at the culprit's bulbous nose. "I could make you confess under torture . I could have my men beat out of you a true confession. I could have them use their sturdy cudgels in decorating your hide with warts. How would that be? Mr. Ample Blanket for Your Rented Wife." I picked up something from the police chief's desk at random, an ink stone for grinding pigment, and hurled it to the stone floor, smashing it to smithereens and spraying debris and black ink in a scatter pattern not unlike that for a detonated grenade. In his own way, the police chief wasn't entirely such a bad sort. He was perhaps more stupid than evil-hearted. I actually felt a little sorry for the oaf. Cowed into submission as he was, frightened into humiliating prostration upon the cold floor before a hairless, skinny, ridiculous-looking teenage boy. But, of course, the telegraph master had gone entirely too far. And in order to check his mischief, I had to make a strong impression. Nip things in the bud. For without the police chief, primary source of local thuggery, the telegraph master would be as limp as a slice of wet bread."One more misstep," I said in a measured cadence, consciously modeled after that of my mentor the good Schoolmaster Ho, "and it's the dung heap for you and your lot. Ask Mr. Wang if he wants to swap his position and wealth for a nice long sojourn in my uncle's prison."Apparently Mr. Wang had no interest in prison, for weeks passed and nothing more happened. Except perhaps that the spring really did seem to arrive a little ahead of schedule. Moreover, almost every evening afforded me a chance, however fleeting, to secretly meet with Lan En-zhang during class recess. The more we talked, the more we seemed to have to say to one another. About topics of local gossip, about the ideas of modern science. About the proper way to cook fish and the vagaries of the local economy. About our fondest memories, our most embarassing moments, our grandest impossible dreams. One unforgettable night when the air was heavy with the almost pungent smell of an imminent storm, when the wind of the storm was already teasing and pushing about the heavy spring foilage of the trees surrounding our school house, it was possibly the electrical charge in the air that finally seemed to instill in me the courage that had been wanting up until that moment."Your parents seem to agree with me," I blurted out even as she laughed at a story I had just finished telling.She asked, "Agree with what?" the chuckle still tangled in her voice. As usual, I kept a wary eye upon the drawn curtains. "It's not what you think.""And what do I think?""I'm sure I don't know.""Ah," she said. "Then this head of mine is not completely transparent afterall."The giggle of one of the girls outside raised the hairs on my forearms and the back of my neck. Feeling the flush on my face, I forced myself to continue: "Your parents agree ... that education is a wonderful thing....  So wonderful, in fact, that they've consented to their transferring you and your siblings to Guiyang for finishing." I coughed.  "Actually, all the parents have, including Zhou Guang-yu's. Of course, for her I'll need to find a sponsor."Lan En-zhang knotted her hands together. She twisted her fingers. "The provincial capital?""You're pleased," I ventured. "Aren't you?"After a pause, she quietly but resolutely answered, "Naturally."The taut smile plastered to my face made my heart feel all the emptier. I hadn't meant to say what I had said. Not that every word wasn't true, but the heart of the matter lay elsewhere. I must have dragged the toe of my worn cloth shoe across the coarse floorboards because it caught on something jagged and pulled off from my foot. This accidental antic ellicited absolutely no sign of glee or amusement from Lan En-Zhang. I hastily put back on my shoe.Lan En-zhang said softly, "Teacher Zhou. In our city you are a man of great prestige." She shut her eyes and ceremoniously bowed at the waist, bringing her upper body parallel to the floor. "You have done the impossible, and all I can do to honor you is to show the top of my head."I said, "I'm leaving too."She immediately straightened up. She stared at me with wide, disbelieving eyes. "In a few months," I hurriedly added. "And where," she asked, breathlessly, "are you going?""To Guiyang, but it's not what you think.""It's not what I think?" she fairly echoed, her face working. "What is it that I think?""No," I said. "Or perhaps ... I mean.... " I dropped my eyes and shook my head. I cleared my throat; I coughed a second time. I found it impossible not to scratch the backs of my hands, which were not in the least bit itchy. I said, "You see," struggling to maintain myself, to prevent my poor unstable ship from falling to pieces in the middle of the sea, "Master Ho has shown me a newspaper from Canton.  It says that Dr. Sun Yatsen is gathering an army there." I forced myself to look up again, to look into and search those steady eyes of hers.  "He vows to fight the warlords and take the country back from the foreign devils. There's going to be another revolution. This time it's going to succeed." I gave her a feeble little smile. She did not respond. Not in the slightest. Was she even listening? She seemed intent but upon something else. Distracted by another, more important preoccupation. I blundered on, "I'm to be part of it. Eventually, at least, once I find a way....  But right now that's all immaterial because, you see, no matter where I go, Miss Lan, or what I do ... it would very much please me ...  if we could always have such chances as this  ... to talk .... and be together."Her eyelids pinched into an intimidating squint. I stumbled backwards towards the part in the heavy curtains, the force of her stare pushing me away, the voices of the boys pulling me. "Yes," she called after me."Yes?" I said. "You mean ... yes?" She repeated, most emphatically, "Yes."I quickly slipped through the curtain and ran to my table.Two Skies     vtiny @T:|c.N cqy17yz'''%''2}26u6x:;;;;;;?==CtCwECEU____________f\f}ffffffffffffggggg%gFgmgggggggggh&h4h=hhhhhhhii0@P@TJBKC )!J!!"3$[%J''(((*+.#.2223P56899:;B<<=a=>[>?@@@@CbDEEAEFqGJ LrMMMQSQRR]RuVRuRRTUU6UxWAX]XyXXY+YWY[\w^k_&_C_h_______ffffgghhiii&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@%d avenues of imperial Beijing andsomeday held byBut preferably no taller than myselfethereal ingots thehalfometry problems for the second partd her for only a moment, yet straight wardLan En-zhang as she I had originally imaginedn the curtains with my hands.

7#$x( \ \ \ \ \ j.       !Dx ! !&*&< \&! &&'2&&&&&&Chapter 11: Breaking AddictionSitting on a foot stool in the Ho household kitchen, I lay my pipe and smoking paraphernalia down upon a square piece of white cotton cloth spread out over the floor of tamped earth. I carefully picked up two opposing corners of the cloth and tied them into a knot. I repeated with the two other opposing corners, producing a neat little bundle. My host asked me one last time, "Are you sure you want to do this?"I slipped off the stool and knelt down in front of my host's earthen stove. The light coming in through the paper window glazed the stove as well as my outstretched hand an adobe orange so that for a moment I fancied that I too was made out of clay. I opened the stove's wooden hatch and reached my hand a little towards the flames dancing within. I said, "Your wife will be back at any moment. She'll be starting dinner soon. This won't take but a minute.""Once you start," warned Master Ho, "I won't let you stop. From this point forward, you will be committed; requests or demands to the contrary will be ignored. My ears may hear your screams, but my heart will be deaf."I told him, "I understand," and withdrew my fingers away from the heat of the flames.The school master's expression softened. "You're a young man. You have the time that I do not.  I'll be an addict forever, but you won't. It's only a matter of time.  You can wait until you're stronger. You can try the easier strategy first. If that fails, then resort to this ... all-or-nothing proposition. Why risk your life now?""Master Ho," I responded. "Now I have a something to live for." I shook my head. "Later I may not."He frowned and looked at me with a strange expression that suggested concern or pity or possibly envy.  He shook his head. He said, "I hope your reason to live is a strong one.""Oh yes," I said. She was indeed. After feeding my opium habit to the fire, I left Master Ho's house and went back to work. This day I did not prepare a pipe at noon, for there was no pipe left to prepare. Sitting at a desk in the public area of the post office, surrounded by the activity of my workers and our customers, I inspected an office ledger and chuckled softly to myself. "Quitting is simply a matter of breaking routine." For once I was completely without appetite at lunch, and I suffered a mild headache. Retiring to my inner office, I lay down on the cot and shut my eyes. I fancied that I just might be that rare exception, that one in ten thousand or a hundred thousand or a million who escapes practically unscathed. The worst was already upon me; I would be spared the standard torment. Fatigue soon took possession of my body; I became as listless as a broken twig. Still, I couldn't fall asleep.  I was too ... 'uncomfortable'.  With every breath, the eddies of discomfort swelled. In my stomach, in my lungs. My heart pounded; I could hear it and feel it like a fast-beating drum. Someone opened the door without knocking and came in. I opened my eyes. It was Master Ho.I stammered, "Teacher,"  fighting to catch my breath. "I would like ... a pipe ... of opium."He said, "I'm sorry.""A small pipe."He said, "There is no more pipe." Choking with rage, I gripped my head and dug my nails into my temples. I tumbled off the bed and lay on the floor, unable to control my trembling. "Don't throw my own words back at me. What about your pipe? Or if you'd prefer, send someone out to buy me a new pipe. Here. I've got money. In my desk. In my pocket. Just come and take it. Take all of it. All of it."There came no reply. But I knew that the man was still there. Standing over me. Judging me a fool. Judging me a weak and pathetic boy. "I've changed my mind," I hissed. "I accept your recommendation. Quit another day. Now just give me a pipe.  Give me a pipe."The schoolmaster said nothing."Do you hear?" I gasped. " Do you hear ? Or are you a hallucination? Are you a ghost?"He turned to go. He walked out through the door. The door closed shut. I whispered, "Thank you, ghost."I heard the voices of Master Ho and an office worker of mine. I heard a chair being braced against the outside of the door. I heard the voices trail away.A wane light entered through the window above my bed.  I reached toward its dim shaft, but my arm was so very heavy. My hand sank back to the ground. My fingertips pressed into the cool earth. I pulled them across the floor. leaving the shallowest of marks.Invisible needles pricked my skin. I pulled the blanket off the cot. I stuffed a corner of the blanket into my mouth. I bit down with all my remaining strength. Needles penetrated my joints. I felt the metal of every individual needle of a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand of them pushing though my flesh, nosing their nips down through the layers of skin and muscle. I felt a steel blade slicing my fingers from my hands and my toes from my feet. The blade shaved away my knuckles and feet like a paring knife whittling down apples. The blade pressed into my wrists and ankles, severing my hands and feet. It worked up the lengths of my arms and legs, steadily chopping away like a meat processing machine. The machine became a grinder, crunching the bone, turning it into grist. The shoulder and hip joints were nothing to it. It chewed up the sinews, the cartilege, the bone, the marrow. Imaginary tears streamed down my face. "I ... am ... being ... butchered," I sputtered without a voice. My vertebrae dissolved into liquid. The liquid grew hot. The liquid grew scorching. My boneless, limbless body was permeated by molten lead. I  was a rock-heavy worm, wreathing on the ground, being cooked from the inside out, every cell stewing in its own juices."Open the door," I begged to the ghosts in the air. "Open the oven door."When finally I regained consciousness, three days had passed. I had a bruise or two on my body and a tiny scab in the middle of my forehead. No other injuries or blemishes. I had survived and, by surviving, won back my soul.  Master Ho, who had now saved me three separate times, could only continue to long for the full possession of his own life.I did not get another chance to see Lan En-zhang before her departure. She and the seventeen other students went to my elder uncle's home in Guiyang, where they stayed as his guests while attending a local academy. I worked on at my post for four more months until a replacement could be sent out from the provincial capital.

7#$[q9[bWbWeeeefffffffg:xfg gl*l2elg llq,llllllChapter 12: Dream TimeFather lay asleep on the living room sofa with his legs pressed together, bent at the knees and drawn up a bit towards his face. His hands were gathered close to his chest as though he were cold. I looked up and saw Mother. She was standing beside me. Her back was very straight, her shoulders square. She held my sword, the one Father had given me when I was twelve to learn how to fight in the old way.  I said, "Mother, do you know how to use that?" She seemed to move without walking, she seemed to glide or drift toward the sofa, raising the slender, doubled-edged blade as she went. She lifted the sword high above her head. She poised it over father. She stiffened her arms. She tightened her grip. She prepared herself for the downward swing. Braced herself for the fatal contact."Mother," I cried and lunged for the sword, catching it on the blade, yet there was no blood. I wrested the weapon from her. "What were you thinking?" In the next moment, Mother was holding the black anodized knife I had used in the Outback. Before I had the chance to react or even think, she put the knife's needle tip to Father's soft exposed throat and looked to me. I held my breathe, not daring to grab for her weapon a second time, knowing somehow that I could never reach it in time if she so determined. My pixie of a mother, with an expression as unyielding as granite, slowly moved the knife away from Father and raised its lusterless black blade to eye level. She pointed the tip at me.  "Take it," she said, "and kill your father." "No," I said in horror.  "Kill your father now, and spare him the solitude."In the next moment, I awoke and sat up in my sleeping bag. Snowflakes falling from the black sky landed on my face. melting almost upon contact to impart their wet chill to the surface of my skin. Incredibly, it was a light October flurry in the West Texas desert.  After what might have been a minute or two, I regained enough composure to check my watch with a flashlight; it was five o'clock in the morning. I'd bedded down at a quarter til two. It wasn't that I felt rested. Not in the least. It was that I was now too awake to fall back to sleep.I got up, tossed my gear into the back of the Honda and climbed behind the driver's wheel. After warming up the engine, I eased the vehicle off the land and back onto the road.The snow soon stopped falling. The dawn drew close.  The cloud sheet, which extended nearly to the horizon, began to glow pink. After a time, the brilliant crown of the sun appeared in the rear view mirror of my car. The sun rose; the shadow of the earth receded to reveal rolling hills of sage brush frosted in gold. There wasn't a bird in the air. I felt as alone as I did in the Australian desert, and the land was as beautiful.  But driving down this stretch of Texas highway I was safe, with no yielding sand and dust to trap my tires, no needle thorns and jagged rocks to puncture them. To me, this was not reality.I did not believe that what I had experienced was anything more than a dream, a nightmare. It was surely not a vision. Mother had not traveled with me. She was at this moment already back in Pennsylvania, back in our house, settled in nicely with Father. She was keeping him invisible company, watching over him, guarding over him as he lay asleep hours yet before their dawn.It was not she who had censured me, criticized me, berated me, commanded me. It was not she who had condemned me for what I was doing. But then again, what was I doing? Conducting a rolling trial of a man and his life? Meting out imaginary punishment for the deadly crime of neglect? Or was I simply and purely making a move for myself? Going out west as they used to recommend of young American men. Embarking on a quest for adventure and opportunity. Leaving behind the folks. But that was it, wasn't it? So plainly true. Almost self-evident. The dream, it had come of guilt, it had come of self recrimination. It had come of my good old Chinese upbringing. The default programming had kicked in. The operating system had overridden all contradictory software. I was going westward, always westward, but in my mind I seemed to be traveling with him in that direction from the town of Zun Yi to the city of Guiyang. North was it? South, west or east? I hadn't a clue. Metaphorically, I supposed it was the direction of progress: from the back waters to the slightly more advanced provincial capital. And the mode of transportation was most certainly foot, since I seriously doubted that Father would have hired a sedan chair even in his condition after breaking opium habit. In contrast, how was I traveling? With a smirk I glanced at the instruments panel of this cheap leaky Honda, which could not have been more incredible to the young revolutionary had it been a chariot of the Emperor of Heaven. In a matter of minutes I flew farther than he could trudge in a day. Why did I enjoy such fantastic advantages when he had had none? Why was it for me infinitely easier than for him? I might have been moving fast, but in another sense, in a much more important sense, I was moving slow, like a turtle or a snail. That young man with the bundle of cloth slung over his shoulder containing all the possessions in the world that he cared to keep, that young man with not even shoes upon his feet but only straw sandels, he was leaving me behind in his tracks, far far behind. I could not even hope to catch up.This was some different type of guilt. A variation on a theme. Here was the guilt of failure. Of not measuring up to the father. Of not having learned properly or putting into practice the lessons he had tried so hard to impart. Of having wasted his year's of effort and energy, of sacrifice and self-deprivation. Of being unworthy of his unreserved love if not attention. Of not being the man that he had taught me, he had nurtured me to be. Forget that he had taught the wrong lessons or taught them improperly. Forget that he hadn't been there as a friend and not a task master and provider. Forget that he had allowed the disappointments and failures and fears of his own life to add presure to pressure, warping his children. Forget that he who had been like a child himself raising children, that he who had never really had a home or family or caring parents of his own growing up should be like a blindfolded man with a twelve foot plank tucked beneath his arm plowing his way through a porcelain factory.I aided gravity by pushing my right foot forward, depressing the accelerator pedal. As my speed surpassed eighty, then eighty-five, then ninety and ninety-five, the tachometer needle swung wildly, and the car began to lurch and shudder. I inched past one hundred, one-hundred-and-five, one-hundred-and-ten. The chassis shook violently. The combined, melded sounds of the wind and tire traction were in my ear like the roar of a hurricane. I delighted in thinking that something in the engine compartment might rattle off, the alternator perhaps or at least a battery mount. Or maybe a drive belt would snap. Or maybe ... maybe the engine would explode, sending jagged bits of hot iron flying in all directions like artillery shrapnel. Some would surely fly through the windshield. I couldn't help myself smiling. Playing with fire was a lot of fun not to mention a vent for pressure.My foot eased up off the pedal. The tachometer needle slowly began to stabilize, steadying itself around seventy miles an hour.Once in the Outback, my land cruiser had gotten stuck on top of a sand ridge. When the usual tricks had failed, I had very nearly lost control of my bladder. What a mess that would have made. But instead, I'd used a shovel to dig a trench around my drive wheels so that the spinning tires reached wet sand, catching just enough traction to jolt the vehicle forward. The cruiser dove down the dune's avalanche slope, and I felt like a kid again sled riding in winter.  The pink and gray cockatoos crying overhead were the living ornaments of a dazzling blue Christmas sky. "Lets see him top that," I said with a deep sigh, and I drove on through the waning desert night, traveling away from the dawn.By noon the next day the dilemmas of the west Texas desert were three hundred miles behind me. I ate graham crackers at the wheel and mused over the golden days that lay ahead. A smile wreathed my face as I took a right turn at the Pacific Ocean and sped north towards the city by the bay.When I arrived late in the evening, the welcome I received at my sister's home in Sunnyvale was warm. A room had been prepared, and her two housemates told me to stay as long as I liked. So I settled in. Despite the contrast between my personal appearance and the svelte feminine figures in their brochures, I started work as a Kelly Girls temp. Not doing office or data entry work, however, but packing boxes in warehouses and loading them onto conveyor belts.On idle days I made the rounds of companies involved in publishing, the industry in which I hoped to make a mark.  These included textbook companies, newspapers and advertisers but also large manufacturers, software companies, universities and entertainment firms.  My beat ran up the bay from Palo Alto to San Francisco and down the other side. Evenings were spent at local libraries researching the job market, taking long walks through suburbia and watching television with Jennifer and our housemates.I even had near at hand a few people from back home. Most of my socializing came to revolve around Andrea MacNeal, a good friend from high school. I might not have been a hit within her circle, but they received me politely enough. How could it be otherwise when I soon became amorously involved with the ingenue of the groupan auburn-haired twenty-year old named Maria. Although Stanford medical school limited her free time to one night on weekends, I was grateful for the hours we did share.Without really knowing Maria well, I opened up my heart to her with all its dreams, even revealing the secret plan to build a cattle ranch in Montana.  In the meantime, I would content myself with a career in publishing.  Who knows? Some entry-level position as a lowly proof reader might eventually develop into an editorial commentator for a slick national news weekly. She smiled at my ambitions, and I smiled too, wryly and shrewdly, because I knew that fantasies could at least be exploited to gain the realistic objective of a steady job. Ambition was wind for my sails, fuel for my rockets. Shooting for the moon, I would land on the ground.The weeks slipped by, and still no job.  One by one, I phoned or went back to the dozens of concerns with which I had left materials. This exhaustive enterprise earned the privilege of a single interview.Challenge 2000 was a small Palo Alto company specializing in children's workbooks on Math and English. Since sales had recently experienced several successive leaps, management had charted a course for rapid expansion, which required a team of new product developers. It was for one of these positions that I was interviewed by the company's vice president."You've had quite a variety of experiences," said Mr. Morsley, a large man with receding hairline. I said, "Thank you."The VP, seated behind a wide wooden desk, wore a pressed white shirt and lemon yellow tie speckled with tiny blue diamonds. Leafing through my resume, he said,  "Roofing and handy work during college. Leading a back-country crew in the Smokey Mountains during one summer, leading a logging crew in Utah the next. Teaching English to language professors in China. Why, you were once even a graphic artist."I smiled, unable to fathom Mr. Morsley's bland expression.Grinning, as though in telepathic response to my uncertainty, he said, "Oh yes, we do read cv's."Realizing the mistake of having crammed everything into the cvhe old "shot-gun" approachI chuckled and resisted an urge to sit on my hands. It nettled me to admit even just in my thoughts that I should have listened to my sister for a change and submitted a focused, tailored single-pager.Mr. Morsley lay down my resume. He said, "Tell me about being an artist.""That was mainly during my teens," I confessed. "I'm afraid I glorified reality a bit. I mainly sold pictures at local sidewalk shows.""That's it?""Um.... I also displayed in a few galleries and picked up the odd commission."He briefly pressed his hands together before his mouth before lowering them again to his desk top. He picked up a paper clip, examining the metal, its shininess, the clip's tight round bends. It was almost as if he were searching within this tiny miracle of modern molding or extrusion technology not for any profound truth but simply the next thing to say. The man had lost complete interest. In the blink of an eye. When would I get another interview with anyone? How long before I finally got a real job? Strangely, I was almost moved to helping this man caught in his awkward situation with a few suggestions for questions or comments to fill the space, eat up the few minutes before his dismissing me with a "Your qualifications seem excellent, but ..." But what? There are no openings afterall? Just this morning new market forecasts bode ill for sales? We had an unanticipated budget shortfall? Take your pick. Thank you but no thanks.Mr. Morsley suddenly asked, "What were your media and subjects?""For what?""For art.""Oh yes. Of course. Charcoal and India ink. Sometimes acrylic paints. I did animals and people." Peering into my interrogator's unblinking eyes I somehow deduced that he was waiting for more. Like a fool I added, "On rare occasions I did architectural studies and landscapes."He said, "A little of everything," playing with his paper clip.I confirmed, "A little of everything," pressing my lips into a tight smile."Range," said Mr. Morsley, tapping the paper clip twice against the table top before relinquishing it. He brushed it aside, like a toy hockey puck across the surface of fake ice. "Incredible range."I nodded feebly and said again, "thank you," although I wasn't sure he meant to compliment."Of course," continued Mr. Morsley, cupping his hands together, "your Ph.D. is the most impressive achievement of them all, and the work you did ... fascinating. Could you tell me a little bit more about that?"As briefly as I could manage, I summarized the research, scrupulously avoiding technicality. My inquisitor listened patiently."Fascinating," he repeated. "You must have enjoyed the work.""Yes," I lied.  The VP sat back in his chair and put his hands behind his head. "You know?" he said with a sigh. "It's the one place that's always captured my imaginationthe Australian Outback. It's a dream of mine to see it for myself someday. Could you ... maybe tell me a little something about it?"Interviews can be such portentous games. The applicant needs work, that is to say, livelihood. The employer needs a single likely candidate, which compels him to screen out all the rest.  It's ginger yet desperate offense versus merciless defense.  Mr. Morsley's relaxed pose told me that the conventional interview was over, at least for the moment. His guard was down; here was my real chance to impress."At night," I obliged, "kangaroos come out in scores.  By day, wedge-tailed eagles ride the thermal air currents in search of carrion. Emus trot across the flats.  You can pick a race with one if you like, an emu that is. It's easy enough. They're always game for a sprint. But if you're going to be fair about it, don't floor the pedal until it reaches top speed, forty an hour. Don't steer it towards a cattle fence. If it hits a fence it'll be just as liable to keep banging against it until it cuts its own throat against the barbs as veer away again. Bloody stupid animals. But that's all in the fringe areaswhat most people see when they go 'Outback'. The heart of the beast is a different matter altogether."The senior manager was now sitting at the edge of his seat, his hands finally motionless, resting on the cool smooth table top. His pupils shifted subtly back and forth as in REM sleep; they were following the action. If at that moment I had said, "You will get up, go to the file cabinet and get out a standard employment contract," would he have done it?"In its heart, the deserts pass, each distinct yet ... unimaginable, like scenes in a shifting dream.  You cross a seemingly limitless plain of purple rocks, and almost without your awareness, it changes into a sea of orange whaleback dunes. Around their sandy flanks grow milk-green bushes out of which bolt strange egret-like birds that leap into flight. Come early evening, you camp between two bone-white sand ridges that stretch away into the distance.  Sunset slowly colors the sky like fire consuming a sheet of blue paper. The air is hot, oven hot. It's been a thousand miles since you last saw another living soul; out here roam only dingoes, solitary and unapproachable."Tomorrow you may wake up to a different world. The temperature rises still higher, perhaps to the point that your pencil tip melts to drip trembling grayish silvery beads onto your sheet of paper and a falling match ignites upon hitting the ground. Or the sky breaks open like a cracked melon, and it rains and rains and rains until every speck of moisture has been wrung out of the air and into the flood. The dunes turn into islands, the desert an inland sea. You race to find stony ground for your tires; if the land cruiser bogs down, you could drown. On the other hand, you could shrivel up in the sun once it burns away the clouds. End up as shrunken and wrinkled as a raisen. You could even succumb to starvation. Out here, one needs a bit of luck."Distrusting the night, I slept with my black knife beneath my neck and my shovel by my side. At three o'clock in the morning, I awoke. The hot winds were already sweeping parched plant debris across the plains, making it impossible to sleep. I turned my sleeping bag around so that I could lie facing downwind. I would rest for another hour and then get up. I eased myself down. As soon as my face touched the bundle of clothes that served as pillow, a strange sensation washed over my body. I tried to move an arm, but it refused to obey.  Instead, it began to vibrate. I tried to turn my head, and my head trembled.  I could see the plains, yet I knew my eyes were shut.  I commanded my body, "Get up," and it shook so violently that I thought I might be dreaming through an earthquake.  After this, I lay still.A short time passed without event. Then, suddenly, I heard soft footsteps in the sand, coming up from behind. Next, a dull, metallic ringmy shovel had been lifted off the ground. Seconds later, a face appeared before my eyes. A white man, thin but not gaunt, pale but not ashen. He was leaning over me, peering into my face.The stranger stepped away so that I could see his entire body. He had short dark hair and grey work clothes.  The style of his high-top leather boots suggested the early 1900s.  Slowly, he raised the shovel above his head. This was the end; I was quite certain. I shook so hard that I felt myself leave the ground. In a sort of rational terror, I tried to focus on a nearby rock, a stick of scorched vegetation, the light haze of flying sand, the blackness above the horizon.  Still, I couldn't help myself watching the shovel from out of the corner of an eye, awaiting its heavy swing and blunt blow. Awaiting, perhaps, its dull edge, still sharp enough to separate my head from my neck like an unsharpened ax.The man threw the shovel high into the air, and when it came crashing down to the sand, he threw himself upon the ground. There he lay, facing away from me.  The dust slowly settled, and the last breath of wind died away.For a long time, I shared the vast desert silence with this motionless companion. When eventually came fresh footsteps, I did not bother to struggle. What would happen would happen. I was resigned to meeting my fate, to coming to an inglorious end. So many before me had perished at this age or younger. In the end we were all but dingoes and emus. Completely unexceptional. Without special consideration. Dead, we were but lumps of rotting flesh. Later a scattering of bleached bones. Inanimate objects. Like rocks or pieces of discarded wood.Tomorrow would I be looking down upon this piece of discarded rubbish much as the new stranger was looking down upon me now? Would I by chance become like just another stranger? Wandering out through the wasteland, wandering with the blowing sands in search of the sight of someone still alive? Would the years pass like seconds or the seconds like years? I was suddenly scared, suddenly terrified. No longer indifferent and ready for come what may. Yet, I didn't try to move again either. That would be useless. Nor did I search my mind for a plausible plan of action. Sailers in a crippled submarine, with depth charges descending all around and blossoming with the fury of thunderbolts, hold on to whatever cold steel bar comes within reach, and they wait. Revolting within themselves, screaming for rescue and salvation into the void of their own minds pressed to the boundaries of sanity, they stand unable to voluntarily move a muscle, and they wait.In the next moment what happened was that I felt not the bite of a steel edge or the sledge of a steel mass but, rather, the gentle touch of a hand brushing across my forehead. Fingers combing through my haiir. My mother's face appeared before my eyes. She smiled. "Don't worry," came her soft voice. "Don't worry about a thing. Just relax. Just let go. Just let go." She continued to stroke my hair, to reassure me.  I shut my eyes, and the spell was broken.  I struggled to my feet, my limbs still tingling. The wind was blowing again. Debris was flying against my sleeping bag, against my body and face. Snakes of sand drifted across the desert floor.During Mother's long hospital convalescence she had told me that Grandfather used to come to her in her dreams saying, "Let us go and look for Guang Yu." Then together they would search the barren lands, but apparently I was never found.So it must have been Great Grandmother, I fancied, that intrepid girl who had once cut flesh from her body to save her mother. She had assumed my mother's form to deliver me in a moment of need.  How queer that a single visitation could liberate me twice, first from paralysis in the Outback and now from unemployment in Sunnyvale through the retelling of a dream. Mr. Morsley's fascination with Aboriginal dreamtime had been a godsend. It was only a matter of time before I got the signal from Challenge 2000. Deep in my heart, I knew then too that the UN appointment would be mine.  I could almost taste the African dust. The apparition of the West Texas desert had been but a nightmare.

7#$A3UxAHWHWIGIGIGIUMsMsMsMMMMN%xIN NR*S/IGRN RRUL,RRRRRRChapter 13: The Chinese CowboyA week after my interview with Mr. Morsley, I met Maria for lunch at Stanford. We brought bagged sandwiches and picnicked on the rim of a fountain in one of the university's many paved courtyards.  The late November air was bracing, but the strong sunlight warmed our backs. With food and drinks neatly laid out between us, I prepared to tell Maria the big news: I had quit Kelly Girls! But first, I would beguile her."I've decided," I announced, "to take riding lessons." Her look of perplexity made my grin all the broader. "There's a stables nearby. I see a lot of people riding around in that park lands area east of campus." I began to laugh. "You know where I'm talking about?"She nodded."Most of them," I said, "look like yuppie housewives or something. Such good posture in the saddle. Shoulders squared. Very well attired. Prim and proper. But not me, boy." I shook my head. "I'm going to lean low over the mane, whoop and holler, ride like a wild Berber flying over the North African desert dunes."I continued to talk about riding horses and practicing my one hundred meter dash and finding a decent pick-up soccer game, moving fast in general. Relaxed and moving fast. In every aspect of my life actually. I would take advantage of the university library, read great books, research desertification control, begin two journals, one personal, the other scientific. Between snippets of the grand plan, I wolfed down quarter sections of my bologna and lettuce sandwich like big gulps of air. Maria seemed to be listening, maybe even in rapt attention. I stared into those lovely hazel eyes; I drew in the familiar scent of her body with every breath I took to fuel my ridiculous narrative. Even as I spoke and I felt the chill of the air and the warmth of the sun both at the same time, I pictured again in my mind the week before when Maria and I had made love in her bedroom. I laid my hand against the hard concrete of the fountain rim, but my finger tips felt the soft skin of her bare buttocks and thighs. I traced out a rough map of my old Outback haunts in central Australia on coarse concrete but my hands ran down the smooth outsides of her legs, then up the smooth insides, spreading those legs apart, despite the mild resistence, prying them apart like the thick rind from the fruit of a most sweet and succulent  orange. I lifted my head a little, spouting my nonsense into the air, invisibly mimicking the fountain behind us, and I saw in the dim light of her veiled bedroom lamp her pert little nipples standing errect and hard. I tasted them on my tongue, a little salty at first. I took her breast full into my mouth and lay down on top of her, feeling the length of her warm body against mine as I did so, reaching with a hand, an inquisitive finger, into her unseen wetness, plunging my finger down as deep as it could go, then finding the petals of flesh that when massaged and fluttered made her squirm and wreath beneath me in apparent pleasure.I lowered my gaze again, down from the sun burnished sky, down from the adobe mission tower of some university building, and I saw Maria, sitting there chewing her sandwich, fully dressed, a very picture of serenity and contentment. I prattled on and began afresh in my mind to unbutton her blouse. The white plastic buttons were small, tiny really, but my fingers possessed considerable dexterity.  I unbuttoned down to her chest; she wore no bra. I admired the smooth valley of tanned flesh between her still blouse covered nipples. I unbuttoned to her navel and kissed her soft, heaving belly. I reached both hands inside her now totally unbuttoned blouse, so light against my skin. I reached my arms around her slender waist. I kissed her on the mouth, tasting the interior of her mouth with my tongue, tasting the unaccountable sweet corn flavor of her saliva, detecting a minty hint of her toothpaste. I saw her pull herself away from my embrace; I saw her press me backwards, press me down upon her bed. I saw her kissing my neck, my throat, licking my Adam's apple, licking my chest between my nipples, planting kisses on the tensed muscles of my abdomen and, finally, reaching my penis, which she put her mouth over, like a wet, warm, snug-fitting cap. Sitting there at the edge of the fountain, my going on and on about who the hell knows what, I had the terrific urge to reach down into my pants. I didn't think I could wait until tonight when we would be together again. I almost doubted that I could make it through the next minute. I was a sexual time bomb; the second hand was racing towards detonation."David," suddenly interrupted Maria."What?" I said. "You, uh, you, uh, you, uh, want to take riding lessons too?""No," she said. "I want ... a change."Maria wasted little time in alluding to certain large issues of her own that needed sorting out. Or, rather, sifting through. And dealing with. Once and for all. This wasn't perhaps the best point in her life for a serious relationship. For that matter, any type of relationship. She knew that she was being awfully selfish, but now was one of those times when it was important and, furthermore, relatively harmless to be selfish. If not now during her student days then when?I immediately told her that I possessed the deep concern and patience to help her cope, if she would only let me. Whatever her issues, it didn't matter. I would understand; I could accept. I hastily asserted the stupidity of riding lessons and a cattle ranch in Montana. I was showing her that I myself recognized the level of absurdity. Who had ever heard of a Chinese cowboy? It was just my way of venting. Releasing some steam. Verbal catharsis. A type of home grown self therapy. My idiotic claims and moronic ramblings had no real meaning. In fact, I meant nothing by them whatsoever. But now, at least, I realized just how annoying they could be. How off-putting. How alarming perhaps. Never another word. I swore, and I vowed, with one hand held up in the air and the other placed on an imaginary bible. I was one who understood what life was about. I knew that she, this medical student at one of the top medical schools in the country, nay, the world, had no time for self-deluders. She had no time for losers. By the way, had I seemed squirmish just now, not a minute ago? Had I seemed jittery and at the same time distracted perhaps? Had my face appeared flushed? Maybe I was coming down with something. Or maybe it was just all this crazy talk of mine. Spewing out of my uncensored mouth as it were. Again, I promised not another word. Besides, soon there would be other things to talk about. I would have a real job. It was a virtual certainty. All I needed was another minute, another few seconds, and I could tell her about all Mr. Morsley and Challenge 2000. Did she have the seconds to spare? Lunch time wasn't over yet, was it? It seemed as though we had hardly just begun. There was still the fruit I had brought for the two of us. An apple for her and a pear for me. I'd remembered just how much she liked crunchy, juicy Cortland apples. I held up for her the cool red fruit, shiny in the sunlight. I should have just started talking. I should have simply blurted out the real big news, the truth about where I was headed. But before I could, Maria shook her head and insisted "no." She wanted "out".  I lost my appetite. She escorted me to the parking lot and my Honda.After finishing my last Kelly Girls assignment that afternoon, I ate dinner at a MacDonalds and then went to a bar for a few beers. When I came out, I still didn't want to go home. So I wandered the streets for an hour or more and then checked into a movie, leaving before it was halfway through. I drove aimlessly from strip mall to strip mall until around eleven-thirty when I decided to steer for home.  Since Jennifer, Patty and Ross all had to get up early for work, I figured the household would be asleep by the time I arrived.As I pulled into the driveway, I saw that practically every light in the house was on.  For a moment I considered driving away, but the temptation faded. I got out of the Honda and walked to the door.  Just as I pushed my key into the lock, the door opened; my keys fell to the ground, clattering on the pavement. Jennifer stood before me with a wine glass in her one hand and a crumpled up piece of paper in the other.  "Hi," I said and bent over to pick up my keys."Where have you been?" she asked."Out with some friends," I said. "You're blocking the doorway." Jennifer stepped aside. "Thanks," I said, and I entered, heading straight for the kitchen."You got a letter today," she told me.Looking over my shoulder, I glanced at the wad of paper in her hand.  I said, "Oh?" opening the refrigerator door. "Is it in my room?" I pulled out a carton of orange juice."That belongs to Patty and Ross," declared Jennifer."Patty?" I shouted, "do you mind if I have a little bit of your orange juice? Like half a glass or something?""They're not at home."Orange juice in hand, I walked to the entrance and looked down the hallway towards their room. The door was open. "Lights are on.""Yeah, well," said Jennifer, nodding her head, "they left them on when they went out."Shuffling back towards the frig, I said, "If they're gone, why don't you switch off the lights for them? Or hadn't the thought occurred to you?" "It's not my room.""Obviously.""IT'S NOT MY ROOM!" screamed Jennifer.I looked at my sister; she glared back at me. Her hair was disheveled, there were dark sags beneath her eyes. The reek of alcohol was heavy on her breath. This was not the time to pick a fight. I shoved the orange juice carton back into the frig and shut the door. "Fine," I said and walked away.I went into my room and shut the door.  Jennifer opened the door and came in after me."What?" I turned around to face her. "What?""You just don't care about anything, do you?" She took up position in front of the door, presumably to block escape."I thought this was my room. Or doesn't my privacy count for anything?""You don't care about drinking other people's orange juice. You don't care about leaving bread crumbs all over the counter. You don't care about leaving water in the soap dish.""Where on the counter? I do not leave bread crumbs on the counter.""Underneath the toaster.""So what? Doesn't everybody? Nobody will notice.""People care."I shook my head. "It wasn't Patty who checked for bread crumbs underneath the toaster." I smiled. "What's with you anyways? I mean, you never used to be this bitchy before I went to Australia. You're hostile to me now just the way you used to be with Dad. Have I become like a Dad equivalent? Like a mini-Dad? Do you take things out on me because he's gotten too old and frail, and you'd feel guilty if you took things out on him?" I watched my sister and waited for response. Her face working, Jennifer stammered, "You don't even care about getting a job.""Yeah, right," I said. "Change the subject."  I sat down on my mattress, which lay on the floor. I turned my back to her. I picked up a sports magazine. I pretended to read."What," she demanded, "did you say at that interview with Mr. Morsley?"I lowered my magazine and twisted my neck to stare up at her. "What do you know about that? How did you get his name?"A smile slowly spread across her face.I looked again at the wad of paper in her hand. I half expected her to start tossing it into the air and catching it again like a baseball. But she didn't. She merely stood there and smiled. "That paper in your hand," I said with as much menace as I could impart to my voice.  "Is that ... my letter?"He grin seemed to grow wider, if that was possible, to grow in the intensity of the delight it registered. She handed the paper wad to me and patiently waited as I worked it open and smoothed it out. It read: "Dear Mr. Zhou. You were one of the few applicants we seriously considered for the job of director for curricular development, but after a careful review of your credentials, it was evident that our position would not suit someone of your caliber.  We need a person for the long-term, and quite frankly, we felt that here you would soon become bored.  May I say that I found you the most intriguing of our applicants and am fully confident that your rare qualifications will soon earn for you an appropriate position.  The very best of luck. Robert T. Morsley."As I lowered the letter, Jennifer attacked: "You just can't lie, can you? You just have to tell everybody exactly what you think about everything because you're so honest!" Her whole frame seemed to quiver. To vibrate. She seemed not a person with autonomy of movement but someone attached to a piece of industrial equipment specifically designed for shaking things. Crossing her arms, she continued, "Well, nobody's interested  in what you think. They want to hear what they want to hear, and if you don't give it to them, they won't want you.  Can't you understand that?  Is that so hard to figure out?"I carefully folded the letter and pressed it between my hands. I crawled over to my manila folders stacked up against te wall and slowly leafed through them until I found the one labeled "Challenge 2000". I slipped the letter inside."You know, you can't not get a real job for the rest of your life! You can't just keep working for Kelly Girls forever!  Do you think Maria likes dating a guy who works at Kelly Girls? Do you think she'll want to marry a Kelly Girl? What makes you so special that the world's going to turn inside out for you?  What is it with you?"Jennifer paused to wait for an answer, but when none was forthcoming, she left the room. I leaned over and pushed my door shut."Is it your Ph.D. that makes you so special?" came Jennifer's voice from the kitchen. "Is it your 'creativity'? Your 'sensitivity'?  Do you know what the world does to sensitive people?"I heard the refrigerator door open and then I heard her pour out a drink, which I knew wasn't orange juice."You think I wanted to be a screw-off at college and end up in social work?" she said. "You think I like what I'm doing now'data processing'or that I enjoy going to nursing school and wiping the shit off of other people's asses?  I want something interesting to do too." There came the crash of shattering glass. "Fuck!""Well, does the theater," I shouted at the door, "pay any better than data entry or nursing?""I wanted to have a husband and kids by now," moaned Jennifer.  "I wanted to have a family.""Or," I pursued, "aren't the contracts that great for B-grade community playhouse actresses?" I began to laugh.  "Or maybe ...  maybe  ...  Hollywood's going to start auditioning for someone to play a misfit, melodramatic Chinese-American lush?!"There came another crash. "FUUUCK!"I jumped to my feet and opened the door. Running to the kitchen I found Jennifer bent over the sink."Are you okay?" I asked, thinking she was about to vomit."You're a loser too,"  she said quietly. "I once thought that you were different, that you could get whatever you wanted. But now I see you're just the same as me." The corners of her mouth arched down, and a trembling pearl of red wine clung to her chin. The wine drop refused to let go and fall to the floor."Things will get better," I said.She shook her head. "They did something to us growing up. They made it so we can never fit in. Not here, and not in China. Not anywhere. We're stuck. Stuck in the middle of the ocean. Forever.""You blame Mom and Dad?""I haven't had my period since she died," said Jennifer softly, and she lowered her head to press her eyes against the back of her hand. "You are just like Dad." Turning away, I looked at the glass shards scattered across the dark tile floor, glinting like stars against the black void of outer space. The black void of nothingness.The next morning I found a note beneath my door. It read: Patty and Ross have asked me to ask you to find a new place to live. It's Patty. She thinks you're too messy. I'm sorry. If you need some money, maybe I can help you a little. Jennifer."Twenty minutes later, I was back in the Honda, meandering through suburbia, slowly headed south like a migratory bird in flight before the coming winter.Two Skies     vf the sun both at the same time. of a most sweet and succulent fruitwn as deep as it could go, Like lava from a volcano.

7#$UvX\W\Wddddiiiiiiij{xe<j koI*os3doIk) oIoIv,oIoIoIoIoIoIChapter 14: The Polish BombshellI saw a line of bandits moving through a white mist, moving with such stealth that the forest rhododendron did not nod in their wakes though it did seem to play a little, it did twirl and form  ephermeral, just perceptible curly cues like vortices of water behind swimming porpoises. The line bowed a little in the center, forming a crescent. For beyond the line was the crescent of the camp perimeter. I saw the sentries asleep at their posts, so early in the morning, before the light of day, the perfect time for sweet dreams and nightmares. A steel spike appeared in the palm of the hand of one of the bandits. He crouched even lower now, as though prepared to take to all fours. He seemed to weigh the steel spike in his hand, bounce it up and down. He drew within a stone's throw of one young sentry, whose features were muted by the mist, whose closed eyes were  nevertheless visible, whose pupils moved beneath the eye lids, possibly following the action on a bright sunny day in the fields of his childhood, far far away from this accursed mountain of shadows. The bandit crept forward on hands and feet like a great ape. But then he stopped abruptly, raised himself half way up and whipped his arm, sending the steel spike flying through the air, burrowing a fleeting path through the white mist. As the sentry cavorted again with his brother and his friends back home, as they threw rocks at a watermelon and watched the rocks skip off the thick rind, the steel spike met its target, ending the dream with great suddenness.The traffic light in front of me flashed green. The laws of modern America permitted me to go. I stepped on the accelerator, and the Honda began again to move forward down the boulevard in the flat concrete landscape of urban California. It was a reasonably warm day for winter. My car heater provided for me a positively summerish climate. Nevertheless, I still somehow felt the chill of those mountains in Guizhou. I still somehow felt the bracing mist against the face, the moist exhilaration experienced by the bandits as they rushed forth to take the camp.I knew even as I watched from my perch behind the steering wheel, as I peered beyond this concrete highway that gave the illusion of narrowing to a point in the distance, as I stared down a tunnel of decades and thousands of miles at the calamity about to unfold, that somewhere along that porous perimeter one of the sentries, before he died, would cry out in agony and alarm or, perhaps, even as he died and fell forward would knock over a tripod of spears or a cooking pot, creating such a ruckus that the men within the tents would wake with a start, realize in an instant their grave peril and jump up from their blankets to grab their weapons, poise themselves beside the slit entrance of their tents so that the first bandit that appeared would receive a spear head in his gut, planted so deep that it would take both hands pulling hard and a foot set against the surprised bandit's chest to free it again. The soldiers would survive with minimal casualties. The soldiers would turn the tables on the brigands and chase them back into the mist. However, the soldiers would not permit them to escape. The soldiers would chase them through the forest until the shadows receded, until the sun came up to warm their backs, to watch them at their work as they cut down the murderers like peasants harvesting great stalks of sugar cane at the end of the growing season.The traffic light half a block ahead of me blinked red. The cars that had turned into traffic ahead of me from side streets began to slow down, showing me the red of their rear brake lights. What a drag this early morning rush hour stopping and starting, stopping and starting. But I suddenly didn't seem to mind. For I was once again in a victorious frame of mind. I couldn't be stopped, not by red lights and Silicon Valley congestion, not by brigands and their steel spikes, not by crazy Maria and hay-wired Jennifer. I would cut down the obstacles of my life with a sickle, for they were no more substantial than tall winter wheat bending under the burden of their own tassles. I felt proof against the calamities of war and life.Ove the course of the next quarter of an hour traffic slowed to a virtual standstill. After simmering in my stew for another fifteen minutes before one single set of traffic lights, my imagination flew south of victory, flew south in advance of the Honda, flew south beyond LA where my best friend lived. I kept on going until I reached New Zealand, until I stood once more before a placid bay with numerous tiny moonlight-frosted islands. Abalone clouds scudded across the black, star-speckled sky. There at the edge of land, built half over the water, stood a bar. The shutters of every window were flung wide open revealing a dim light inside. Among the shadows I spied myself. On the dance floor.The music was loud, deafening. I watched myself half-close my eyes.  Beyond the dark drapes of my lashes wreathed the snakelike silhouettes of women's arms lifted high and pushed to and fro by rhythmic currents.  When I opened my eyes again, I found a woman circling me. The wild-eyed, dark-complexioned, thick-limbed, black-haired Maori woman who had been just the minute before sitting at our table nursing a pint glass of dark beer, sitting and swaying from too much of the bitter. I acknowledged the woman with a smile and looked past her. Off to one side at a corner table, I noticed a group of five women; one was a pretty, flaxen-haired White. She and her friends rose together from their chairs and worked their way into the dance floor crowd. The wild-eyed Maori tried to snatch my hand, but I pulled away.Looking to a billiards table, I spotted my traveling companion, a towering Swede engaged in a game of doubles eight ball. A few steps away was the other member of our trio, an athletic, sandy-haired American. A slim, sexy Maori woman who stood with her back to his front, turned her head to one side and smiled at whatever it was he whispered into her ear.  She began slowly to rub her back up and down against his chest.  Twenty or so paces away, a barrel-chested Maori man surrounded by three burly companions glared at this display.  At the fringe of the billiards audience danced another Maori.  He wore a wide-brimmed black felt hat, multi-colored patchwork shirt and baggy black trousers. From his right hand dangled a brown vinyl gym bag, which suddenly dropped to the floor with a dull thud. The man stopped dancing, unzipped the bag and pulled out what looked to be a violet bedspread. Next came a knife with a long, curved blade. Lifting the bedspread to eye level, he stabbed it with his knife and sliced it down its length. He repeated this action again and again and again until the bedspread was a curtain of shreds. The blonde woman danced up to me, very close, and I gave her a faint smile. She didn't seem to notice.  Instead, she synchronized her movements to mine.I was about to say, "Hi". I was about to say, "Where you from? Around here?" When across the darkness reached a pair of hands that grabbed the blonde by the throat.  It was the wild-eyed Maori woman. Almost immediately, someone jumped on her back while another woman pulled on the shoulders of the blonde.  I grabbed the assailant's wrists, but try as I might could not pry away her fingers. The lot of us tumbled to the floor, and the strangle hold was broken.The blonde woman struggled to her feet and staggered off towards a chair. The wild-eyed fury shouted in rage as three Maori women pinned her to the floor. I got up and made my way through the crowd towards the other American and the Swede.  Upon reaching the billiards game, I noticed a few Maoris looking my way. The curious dancing man with the curved knife was nowhere to be seen.  The sexy Maori girl had her back pressed against her American pet, and her boyfriend was now planted firmly in front of her, his arms folded across his wide chest, a sullen comrade to either side. The girl's clumsy smile suggested that she was considering something he'd put to her, probably an ultimatum. As the Swede carefully prepared to take his shot, holding his body very low so that his line of vision ran down the length of the cue, I said, "Jens, are you almost done?""No," he answered calmly. "They've pocketed most of their balls, but I'm not yet ready to concede. The game is still young.""Then is this your last game?" Jens delayed his shot and lifted his head. "You want to go?" he asked.I gave him a significant look, and after only a moment's hesitation he said, "Okay."The barrel-chested Maori took hold of his girlfriend's wrist and tried to pull her away from the American, but she yanked her arm free again. Hoping he would look my way, I glared at the American, who stupidly refused to detach his attention from the girl.As though out of thin air, the dancing man leapt into the clearing before the pool table.  Brandishing his curved knife, he excitedly sang, "Black snake, white snake! Black snake, white snake!" The crowd was instantly agitated, and for a moment, I thought my brawny friend and his overpowering-looking challenger were about to be chanted into a fight. But in the next second, the wild-eyed woman dragged the pretty blonde back into view. Each had her fingers wrapped around the other's throat. The Maori moved her adversary about like a rag doll.  The muscle-bound American moved uncertainly towards the two women.  "Stop," he pleaded feebly. When he reached them he laid a hand upon the shoulder of the powerful Maori woman but was immediately jerked backwards by the antagonized boyfriend, who then stepped in front of him to block further interference.  The billiards audience gathered around the combatants to form a human arena into which slinked the feline Maori siren. She rocked on her feet from side to side shouting, "One against one, not two against one! One against one, not two against one!" Her eyes, burning with ferocity, bore into her American, daring him to flout her edict.The chorus boomed, "One against one, not two against one! One against one, not two against one!"As I worked my way through the crowd, I cast a backward glance at Jens to make sure he had me in his sights.  Holding his pool cue with two hands like a baseball bat he gave me a nod. I closed in on the other American just as he tried to step around his Maori custodian, but the Maori pushed him back again with three fingers and an evil smile.Reaching my compatriot, I took hold of his shoulder and swung him round.  His face was clouded with confusion. "B-B-But," he stuttered, "it's not right.""Don't," I whispered. "Just don't."The blonde broke away from her tormentor and tripped backwards towards the open door. The fury lunged forward and punched the blonde square in the mouth, sending her flying out the door and tumbling backwards down the steps and onto the sand.  The crowd surged after the combatants."One against one, not two against one! One against one, not two against one!"The curved blade danced above the people's heads like a stiff, steel banner. The vanquished woman half-crawled into the bush, and the crazed victor stood at the clearing's edge, arms dangling at her sides like a gunslinger's in an old Western. "Baby, I told you not to piss into gas tank," said the tall, thin blonde, her short hair gelled into spikes and her accent distinctly eastern European."I didn't," meekly protested a massive man in dark glasses, meticulously dressed in pleated coffee trousers, cream shirt and sleek coffee sports jacket  "I simply forgot to throw in gas.""Same thing," said the blonde with a shrug.Their gleaming pink 1960's cruiser was parked by the curb. Sitting behind yet another red light I amused myself by contriving fictions about the curious pair. They were the classic incongruous couple: he the silk-suit junior attorney and she the black leather jacket immigrant punk rocker. Each was alter ego to the other. She had almost perfect features and an unusually high forehead, which might have lent a childlike quality to her beauty if not for the hardness of her facial expression. His features, on the other hand, were bland, run-of-the-mill, roundish. A panda bear of a man. A pencil-thin ponytail distinguished an otherwise conventional haircut. When a police car pulled up behind the stranded boat, the bombshell's red lips seemed to draw tight. She put on her own dark glasses and turned a black-leather back to the scene. The big man's voice rose half an octave as he addressed the officer with a lilting "well hello there".  I momentarily refocued my attention on myself. So which was I? The platoon that could turn total surprise and ambush into total and absolute victory? The soliders who could wake in a start and spring into battle? The champions whose speed and power were all but irresistible? Or the single solitary guy who could turn a pleasant south Pacific evening into a debacle? The kid who was forever turned and tossed and flipped around by a fickled fate? The boy with no control whatsoever over circumstances, over the circumstances of even his own puny actions? The puppet? The marionette? The Pinochio at the end of a set of strings? The boy of faint heartedness and cowardice, of self interest, of self preservation, of self loathing and certainly not nobility, not altruism, not bravery, not heroism? I hadn't known the flaxen-haired White. Not at all. I hadn't even exchanged a word with her. Not a single word. So why should I have cared? Why indeed should I have cared?"Don't," I had whispered to my bewildered compatriot. "Just don't."When the light turned green I didn't race off for the interstate on-ramp but, instead, turned the corner and rounded the block.  Within a minute and a half I was coming up on the patrol car.  The blonde was muttering what I assumed were abuses in Polish judging by the heavy emphasis on "s" and "z" sounds.  The fat man was penguin-walking to catch up with the policeman as he moved towards the trunk of the car.  The officer turned abruptly and stabbed a finger in the air, coming close to poking the fat man in the nose. The junior attorney stopped in his tracks, smiling awkwardly and spreading his fingers across his beefy chest as though to say, "Who me?" I pulled up behind the patrol car and got out of the Honda. Striding for the blonde, I said, "Hey Tadzio. You guys late too?"She eyed me for but a second before breezily informing the officer, "My nickname in Polish. Means exterminator." Turning her head so that the cop couldn't possibly see, she quickly mouthed the name "Michael".I said, "What's up with you and Mike? Caught in the possession?" The fat man chuckled nervously and vigorously shook his head.  The policeman merely smiled."You know these two characters?" he asked standing next to the trunk. "Sure," I replied. "They're famous ... in our little circle.""Well," said the cop putting his hands on his hips, "these neighborhood celebs of yours don't have one license between the two of them.""They never do. I mean, Mike's got one, but he never carries it." I shrugged.  "Can't stand the photo."The policeman smiled again and asked Mike, "Where you kids going?"The big man cleared his throat and offered, "To a breakfast barbecue?" "I don't see any bags of groceries in back. They in the trunk?""Jesus," hissed the blonde gesturing wildly with her hands. "It isn't BYO or pot luck. We are not""We're not expected to bring anything," I explained. "Actually ... Mike here's bringing his own private desert." I smirked and drew my eyes briefly towards the shapely blonde. "If you know what I mean."The blonde fanned her fingers away from her mouth as though throwing me a curse. "'Chung'," she said. "You are piiiig.""The man's got a sweet tooth," said the cop with an appreciative shake of his head.  But in the next moment the demeanor soured again, and he turned once more to the fat man. "Just see to it that you renew your insurance immediately. Start packing that license and take care of the ticket tomorrow. No today. Got that?""Yes sir," said the guilty party shaking his head obsequiously. "Today. Today. Right after the, er, pot luck. I mean barbeque. I promise. I won't forget."The officer frowned as he marched past me back to his patrol car. Pressing down on the bridge of her dark glasses, the blonde revealed her brown almond eyes and cast me a conspiratory grin.  She really was extraordinary, spiked hair and all. The fat man remained absolutely motionless. "No worries," I said to the couple and turned to go myself. In full control. More than in mere full control of myself but rather of the whole situation, for hadn't I played the cop like an accordian? Just right. As I had sepeculated, nothing was going to get in my way. I had shown fate, I had so amply demonstrated to the cosmos, to the air, what was what. No loser here. And this little good deed for the kids from freak city ... well ... just a trifle and the type of thing the troglodyte would not and could not ever do himself. I smiled. I had topped the man. Just like when I had gone alone into the desert. I had exceeded him. I was indeed in command. Perfect command.As the patrol car pulled away, the blonde whispered, "Wait," but I didn't stop and was soon back in the driver's seat of the Honda.  "Wait," she cried skipping to their cruiser. She bounced herself down on the front bench seat and slid across to the passenger's side.  I started the engine of my car, but for some reason kept my foot on the brake, my hand off the clutch. Soon the blonde walked back to me sporting a broad smile. Something bulged in her jacket pocket.  When she reached my window she pulled a plastic sandwich bag out just enough that I could see it was filled with white powder.  "Wish to say thank you.""Where did that come from?" I asked."From my own private source," said the blonde indicating the fat man with a quick nod."Anka," he responded, almost choking on the name. "Are you crazy? I mean, do you really think we should?"Giving her companion a wink, Anka said, "Your boyfriend won't miss it. He gets plenty. Besides, we owe this man something. Maybe our asses.""That was in the glove compartment?" I said. "You're both fucked."Anka smiled a crooked smile.The fat man started walking towards us, explaining meekly, "We didn't expect to be stopped.""We weren't stopped," reminded Anka. "Car ran out of gas."I put the Honda into gear and edged towards the road, but Anka grabbed the steering wheel and held on so tight that the car began to swerve. I stomped on the brake. I growled, "What do think you're doing?"She said simply and rather blithely, "You helped us.""If it were from the goodness of my heart I'd help you get some gas now, right? But I did it for fun, so you're still stuck by the side of the road."With one hand Anka grabbed my fingers and pulled them towards her and with the other hand she drew a pen out of her jacket pocket, clamped the cap between her teeth and yanked it off to expose the pen tip. I think I actually braced myself for an ink injection, for her to carve something into the palm of my hand, like a bloody "x" or maybe an outline of a bunny, but instead, she scribbled a phone number."Baby," she said, "if you ever need help, just call. Anything at all." She let go my hand, which I instinctively wiped against my gray teeshirt, but none of the numbers even smeared. "There's a gas station," I said coldly, "about a block away down Oakley Street."She looked at me puzzled. "So the coke in the glove compartment should maybe add to your sense of 'fun'?"I grinned and said,  "My name is David.""Mine," said Anka thumping her chest with a fist, "Anka Krystyna Sokolowska. In Polish means 'hawk'."Balancing on one leg, the fat man raised the other foot and brushed the dust off his trouser calve. "That's spelled with a 'k-y-r-s' rather than a 'c-h-r-i- s'.""This is Mr. Michael Avner," introduced Anka. "Esquire.""Lawyer?"Michael chuckled, again spreading his chubby fingers across his chest. "Moi?" He shook his head. "Oh, no, no, no. I work in telecom. Systems analyst. Division chief.""Don't believe him," said Anka. "He's mainly pusher." "No, no," hastened Michael. "Not at all." Suddenly he broke into peels of loud, throaty laughter.  "I'm merely our friendly household provider."In the end, I did offer to take them to the gas station, but Anka declined. When finally I got going again and sped onto the interstate, my objective all along, I spit into my hand and rubbed the number off. The purple digits, however, remained indelibly written in my memory.On one straight, endless stretch of highway, about midway between San Fran and LA, radio reception deteriorated to static and my speedometer needle nudged past a hundred miles an hour. The car engine hacked like an old man with tarred lungs. I had sworn to lay off the stuff, to not touch it again, to not violate her memory by paying homage in a way to his, to not succomb to the narcotic of story time, like a child every evening before bed, but in a way, the day bore for me the definitive victory. A thing worth celebrating. And I was dead tired. I didn't really see the harm in a little audio fix. I did for myself what had become for me the easiet, most natural thing in the world, almost like breathing in and out. I popped a tape into the cassette recorder and pressed the button labeled "play".Two Skies     vIt was gray of dawn, and yet my eyes could &("b"f?Q?W@@DDGzG~GGH(H-HIM/M2UUUUUUUUUUUU\W\_\b\l\t\\\\\\]]]]]]&]*]+]N]~]]]]]]]^^^,^-^P^d^e^n^^^^^^^^^^^____._7_D_V_`_e_j@P@Z'(Z,a_6l_!#!"N"o"#$&5()*w++7,S,---.3./125669y9:;h;;<y<=&=o=>>&p@P #p@P B>?Z@A7BWDFrGnGGHWHI)IGIIJpJJKMMN#NNOOOPPPQyRRRTUUUUUUUU]]]^-^__cckcd"dd,Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@8clearly seethe forestnot nod as the bandits pushed through them though the mist did seem to play a little, the mist did twirl and form  of menwell bfull e mist, whose closed eyes were pre- sunrisepink raysgraysuntil the sun swam high in the sky to peer down at them through between the trees, rdistant but still visible periodically changing colorsred, green and yellowbut with minimal movement in the line of cars in front of me,  islands.

7#$<tR;DWDWI,I,I,I:fIIIIIIIJXxIJ JO&*OPI,O&K O&O&RW,O&O&O&O&O&O&Chapter 15: Persuasion of the HeartAt the beginning of my final week in Da Gu Xin Chang, a middle-aged peasant man became smitten with a young girl. He tried to buy her from her parents, and when they rebuffed him, he converted to Christianity and joined the local church. The peasant lamented to his English pastor that the parents of his betrothed had broken their marriage contract after a wealthier match had been found. Outraged, the pastor had the police chief drag the girl to the alter, where she was forcefully married to the peasant. Before the union could be consummated, however, she hung herself from a rafter in her bridal chamber.At the end of my final week in Da Gu Xin Chang, a salt trader realized a tidy profit on the local market by underpricing his competitors. He was able to do this by cheating on the provincial tariff set on salt imported from Sichuan. Because the salt tariff was a French concession, the French trade commissioner ordered the police chief to see to it that the peasant never traded in salt again.  The police chief had the man arrested and both his hands chopped off at the wrists.The morning after this incident, I bid my office workers farewell and left for Guiyang.In the provincial capital, I stayed at my Elder Uncle's estate. On my second evening in town, I paid a visit to the villa of Mr. Huang Qi-shen, the director of the academy at which my former students were now enrolled. As we sat on stone stools in his large, wall-encircled garden, the silver-bearded gentleman pointed a long, bony finger at the bats and swallows swarming the twilight air around a giant parasol tree.He said, "Marvelous acrobats, aren't they?" I agreed, "Certainly are."The bulkiness of his body-length scholar's gown suggested that he wore multiple layers underneath the gown even now in the warmth of May. I had known the old gentleman to be chronically chilled ever since the days when he had been headmaster of the school I'd attended in childhood.My old headmaster informed me, "I've spoken with your Elder Uncle. He is as confident in you as I am. But you must already know that."Frankly, I wasn't quite sure how much Elder Uncle's esteem really meant to me. Not that I didn't owe him the world, but he'd saved me largely out of moral duty and family obligation. Not any genuine affection. Such heartless altrusim might have done for strangers, but we were blood afterall. The man had accomplished sons of his own; what room in his heart for me? It was perhaps I who meant next to nothing to him. My gracious host smiled warmly. "And I've spoken with Lu Tao.  He accepts you as one of the stewards of his caravan." The old gentleman closed his eyes and ceremoniously bowed his head as though in acknowledgement of my tacit thanks. "With so valuable a cargo, Mr. Lu needs competent and trustworthy lieutenants."The cargo was opium, presumably of prime quality. Expectations ran high among the local merchants for the fetching of a handsome price in Hong Kong. Employment on such a caravan would provide me with a profitable as well as safe passage through the brigand-infested mountains between Guiyang and Canton, where Sun Yet-sun's Nationalist Party had its base of operations.I cleared my throat. I believe I may have coughed. I tried to stall for time, tried to think of something clever to say, something disarming and irrefutable, something to which Mr. Huang would be unable to find the words with which to counter. But in the end, without clever recourse, I simply blurted out, "I'm not entirely sure that I'll be able to go." The grainy texture of the gathering darkness did little to soften the old man's scowl. "You see," I hurriedly explained, "I lack sufficient funds for travel.""As a steward," he reminded me, "all travel expenses will be covered. Moreover, when the cargo is sold, there will be additional compensation.""Yes, of course, but there are still things I need to purchase before the journey. Personal effects."Mr. Huang urged, "Cheng-xu," with the strained tone of a parent being tested by a wayward child, "exactly how much money do you think you'll need?" I said, "Actually, my back pay will be more than sufficient to cover everything and more, but it won't arrive until sometime next week ... or the week after that.""But the caravan leaves on Saturday.""Precisely," I concluded just at about the same time that a single point of light appeared in the night, probably the gate keeper's hut abutting the estate wall. An optimistic signal in the fog of my thoughts. "There will be other caravans." Mr. Huang started to chuckle. He started to laugh. "Whatever you really want money for and however much you need, I'll supply the cash." I shook my head, unsure that he could see in the darkness, but immediately he responded, "And why not? You gave most of your money away to those students of yours, and they come from wealthy families. There's no shame in accepting gifts from friends.""Some of my students may have need of independent funds. For the future.""The future?" asked Mr. Huang. "What future is that? Their futures are more or less fixed by their parents, are they not?"What could I do but shrug my shoulders? I had not prepared to debate the details.The gaunt old man sat back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest. He crushed his beard between his chin and neck. But a moment later, he lifted up his head again, slightly. "Well then, a loan. That's alright, isn't it? You can repay me after your wages catch up with you."I said, "No," in so small a voice that I could barely hear myself. "Couldn't possibly accept.""You mean won't accept. Cheng-xu, this is your future you're trying so hard to forfeit."Even at that moment, Lan En-zhang's laughter rang in my mind like the chime of an iron bell. Just hours earlier at my uncle's house, I had found her singing softly in the solitude of the chamber she shared with my other girl students. She had unwound the cotton strips binding her feet and was just then in the process of trying to teach herself how to walk, relishing every faltering step and singing to distract herself from the pain. I had stood there by the half-open door, spying as it were. Without any thoughts to vie for attention, without any needs or appointments to call me away. I stood there in the shadows, motionless, aware of the faint sound of my own breathing. It felt almost as though I were somehow not of this place, not of this life of mine, not yet born perhaps, still in the womb but with a narrow window to the world, the next world, my next world, the world inhabited by this weak yet strong, plain yet hauntingly lovely creature.  I could have stood there and watched her clumsy, courageous movements for the whole of the day and the whole of the night. Suddenly, I became conscious of my host sitting next to me. No doubt staring at my shadowy face. I asked him, "Is it my future?"There followed a long silence during which I looked away in the direction of the parasol tree; its tall silhouette masked an impressively large swathe of the star-speckeled sky. The bats and swallows, which at relatively close distance I could still only make out as darting dark forms, made me think of electrons whizzing about their nucleus, which I had just read about in one of my host's books. My old headmaster sat up in his chair. He nodded his head several times. "Cheng-xu," he began, "you were hardly promising as a boy, but now that you're grown up, your personal circumstances have changed dramatically. Here before me sits a young man of true promise. However, the question remains: promise for what? For whom?" Mr. Huang stood up, actually pushing over the small table that had stood next to his chair and along with it his bowl of tea. I hastily made to retrieve the bowl from the ground, but he motioned with his arm for me to dissist, for me to forget about the tea, and he began pacing back and forth, hands behind his back. He said, "When I led my students to France, we were not 'Confucius and his disciples'.  I was their servant, their follower. I cooked their food and cleaned their quarters. I washed their clothes. When they grew feverish from fatigue, I mopped their foreheads with wet towels. When they grew despondent from homesickness, I wiped the tears from their cheeks. In return, they assumed an obligation, an obligation to learn. But was this obligation to me? To themselves? Or to China?"Just as abruptly as he had stood up, Mr. Huang sat down again and slapped his thigh. He cocked his head back. He crowed to the night, to the black sky. "Thank Heaven for the war! Thank God for the devastation!" The old man leaned forward and tapped me on a knee, and for some reason this light physical contact seemed to have the effect on me almost of an electrical jolt. I remember jerking backwards and knocking my little table over too, watering the grass at my feet with a fine green tea. "Cheng-xu, their machines. You cannot imagine. The people of the West can fly among the clouds, dive to the depths of the sea, whisper to one another across a distance of ten thousand li." He nodded, slowly, ponderously. Like, I imagined, the great steel arm of a great twentieth century machine. "Even in exhaustion, Europe was magnificent and terrible.  If not for the war, what indeed could have saved us? Heaven has granted the reprieve that we presently enjoy, but it will pass in a moment. Like a fantasy of the night. If we should fail to exploit this fleeting mercy..." he bent over and shook his wizened head "...then our nation will surely soon be consumed, swallowed up. China will simply cease to exist, like a memory vanished into the mists of time." His head began to bob up and down, and I questioned that he might not be sobbing until I heard the chuckles. "Pardon the melodrama, but in truth, maybe the only thing that can rouse this country now are you boys.  Chen Yi and Li Li-san.  Deng Xiao-ping and Zhou En-lai.  My own fearless son-in-law Wang Ruo-fei. Remember him?""Yes," I stammered. "Of course,""Tell me then," he coaxed. "What do you recall of the runt?""I remember," I said, "the mornings of our school tournaments. I remember you calling out, 'Youngest of the lower forms and youngest of the upper forms,' and we shyly stepped forward from the ranks, my older cousin Xu-hai and I. You wouldn't let either of us participate in the games and contests because we were too small. It was at these times that the student marshal Wang Ruo-fei would come to us on the sidelines and console us with a promisesomeday we would be big enough to compete.""Certainly, you would!" errupted Mr. Huang brightly. "Just so! Without a doubt!" He pressed his hands together before his lips as though in prayer. He arched his neck and looked up at the sky as though to make out the shape of the words and sentiments that he had released just the minute before, as though those words and sentiments were birds, alive with hope, fluttering with promise. "In Paris, Wang Ruo-fei and the other boys rose before the sun and were at their books before breakfast. The factory work days ran ten, twelve, fourteen hours, but every evening, it was back to their studies. As I mended the holes in their clothes, I reveled in their debates, their 'battles'. Someday, theyChina that iswould stand up again, be able to compete."The old revolutionary leaned forward once more and gave my knee a little shove.  "They no longer pined for home.  How could they?  They had outgrown all that." Bracing an arm against his thigh, the stalwart Bolshevik straightened himself up and barked,  "Chinese nationalism!" stabbing the space between us with a dagger-like finger. "Fraternal socialism!  The hammer is the dialectic, the anvil labor!  They were new men! With convictions forged of steel!"Before me rose the specters of the hanged bride and the handless salt merchant. I could save a girl from the clutches of the lecherous old telegraph master, but I could not save one from an English pastor. I could turn the police chief on his head with fright, but I could not hope to thwart a French bureaucrat. Pity the girl's parents and the girl's spirit. Pity the handless peasant.  Pity the police chief, forever somebody's dupe. Pity me and every other Chinese since ultimately we all dangled at the end of strings manipulated by white-faced ghosts.Laughing out loud, Mr. Huang leaned forward for a third time and held out an open hand. "Will you, Cheng-xu, join their ranks to rebuild the nation, reforge her greatness?"The strain of passions pulling in opposite directions forced my head down, and I began to shake. The sentence formed in my mind: "It isn't for me." But I uttered not a sound. What was it  really that was undermining my resolve, steering me away from my heart's desire?Mr. Huang, seeing my hesitation, retracted his hand. But seemingly undaunted he went on, "If you go to Canton you won't have an old goat like me to look after you, but I guarantee that there will be plenty of comrades. I promise something else too.  You and your mates will end up living like rats, as we did in Paris.  You may  become the happiest rats in China.  Certainly, in our day, there were no happier vermin in all of France."The old gentleman fell silent. I continued to look down, unable to lift my head, for finally, I seemed to understandrevolution was more than political struggle and fighting for country. It was more than hardship, perseverance and sacrifice. It was more even than adventure and seeing the world. It was brotherhood; it was solidarity; it was bonds as strong as blood. It was pouring everything into supporting one another; it was committing everything to the cause. And the cause became the umbrella over all our heads, the blanket that wrapped us in its warm embrace. No, that isn't it. The cause became for all of us wayward boys the true father, the inanimate, invisible, non-existent but spiritual patriarch. Revolution was, in a way, becoming a child again, a member of an unsurpassingly extended and powerful family. It was becoming a brother, noble and pure.I longed to marry Lan En-zhang and settle down, commit myself to the family life, but at the same time real family life was for me a total mystery. It floated shining and beautiful before my mind's eye like a ethereal jewel, yet at the same time it loomed alien, unknown, almost unknowable for one who had been a pass-around child, a virtual orphan. What if I failed? What if I became like my father? What if I became readdicted to opium and squandered away our funds?  What if we slumped into poverty and my family was reduced to begging, to eating table scraps off of dirty restuarant tables? What if I had a son, and my son eventually came to hate and despise me as I had hated and despised my father?Revolution, life among the ranks and in the barracks, life on the march and at the front, the unity of cause, the unity of peril, the kinship of strangers seemed familiar and all-embracing and right and very simply ...  easy. Revolution exerted a greater gravity than love between man and woman.Two Skies     v alter, where she was forced to marry"Thank you," I did remember to say.As kind as you have been in going to such trouble on my behalf, postal service the pain her womb but with a narrow window onphysically willfully almost even latively close distance I could. atomscatchrang only make out as darting streaks the atomwooden procelain  to the night, to the black sky, hammer blowX^2n)*+BHsx48jn+0KO',    !!""""#""""**-y-~...//C/F/g/m22&232;334499<^<_<`<n<o<s<t<y<<<<=====!=A=L=V=]=^=c@P@W*+po];C@O z19"3(e((*-/o12K3Y58q;3<<^<_<p&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@:<p<q<r<s<t<<==^==II,,Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C<@<t(\14<@P@'P@P@=^<p=^ !U/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH(FG(HH(d'@=/=c=============HH6H7H[H|H~HHHHIII+I,@ine.

7#$$2#^*W*W*x*x*x*<*******+nx*+ ,0<*0fk*x0<, 0<0<2,0<0<0<0<0<0<Chapter 16: Beginning and EndAfter the death of the pretender to the throne Yuan Shi-kai, Marshal Cao Kun's election as China's new president was all but assured in both chambers of the national assembly because of the great sums of money spent on buying votes. The country's spiritual leader, however, remained Dr. Sun Yat-sen.  Sun Yat-sen and Marshal Zhang Zuo-lin, an old bandit chieftain who had become the warlord of Manchuria, refused to recognize the new regime. So President Cao Kun's commander-in-chief Marshal Wu Pei-fu determined to compel allegiance by force of arms.Wu first conquered all the lands between the Yellow River in the North and the Yangtze River in the South. This made him China's preeminent warlord. Next he set his sights on Manchuria and old Marshal Zhang.  But just as this fresh campaign was getting under way, Wu's own rear guard commander the "Christian general" Feng Yu-xiang attacked him from the South, marching into Beijing, capturing President Cao Kun and expelling the hapless boy Emperor from the Forbidden City. At the same time, Marshal Zhang with the support of General Duang Qi-rui, a protg of the dead pretender Yuan, attacked from the North. Wedged between two powerful forces, Wu's army was badly mauled. It retreated in disarray to Wuhan.Sun Yat-sen, Marshal Zhang, the Christian General Feng and General Duang met in Beijing to determine China's fate. During this conference, Dr. Sun's fragile health finally gave out. Ironically and unwittingly, it was on the day of the death of the father of the modern incarnation of my country that I signed up for the opium caravan to set a personal course for Canton. My self-appointed mission was to enlist in the Dr. Sun's revolutionary army, which was preparing to march against the illegitimate government's remnant forces. On Saturday morning the caravan assembled at the provincial capital's main market square. We were sixty merchants and stewards and several hundred coolies. The coolies shouldered bamboo staves that balanced enormous bales of opium at the two ends. I stood with my platoon of coolies as Mr. Lu Tao spoke to our great host of men from a second-story window.  His stately pose and booming voice, his utter confidence in himself attested to his former career as a local warlord.After a short while, Younger Uncle entered the plaza astride his prize mule and at the head of a long file of soldiers. Brash cymbols and shrill, nasel pipes proclaimed that the caravan's military escort had arrived.  Elder Uncle and Mr. Huang pushed their way through the throngs of on-lookers to where I stood.Elder Uncle, once seemingly a giant to me, now came up only to the tops of my ears. The diminished colossus clasped my hands in his and shouted above the noise and commotion, "Journey with the wind." Pulling me close, he said into my ear, "In truth, you have already covered, since your lost childhood, a vast and remarkable distance."I suddenly felt quite small again. I turned away from my benefactor, for whom I sensed filtering through my mind an unexpected, unaccountable tinge of affection. I scanned the packed crowd, perhaps in hopes of finding half-hidden among the long skirts of the old Miao women the ragamuffin urchin this little giant of a man had once reclaimed from the streets. Mr. Huang siezed my hand away from Elder Uncle. "Journey with the wind," he cried." And don't dawdle in Hong Kong.""Once the opium is sold," I assured him with a smile, "I'll return to Canton. Then I'll enlist.""You'll make a fine officer," he said. "I'll be lucky to make orderly."He shook his head and laughed. "No. An officer." He laid a hand upon my shoulder.  "We need good ones." And for a moment I wondered if "we" referred to nation or party? The army belonged to the Nationalists, but there was a growing cell of Communist officers, most notably Zhou En-lai himself. Did Mr. Huang count me for one of his own? Count me as a Bolshevik, a member of the vanguard of change and progress? Squeezing the old gentleman's cold, clawlike hand, feeling against my fingers the very bones of his conviction it seemed to me, I vowed to do my utmost.When the speeches were over, Mr. Lu disappeared from the open window and, a short time later, mounted his mule at the head of the caravan.  Younger Uncle pulled his animal back from his troops; the soldiers joined our column.  We began to move forward. Mr. Huang and Elder Uncle walked along beside me, but I urged them, I begged them to stop and go back. For some distance they ignored my entreaties. Eventually, however, they did as asked."Look to my students," I said as they fell behind."Don't worry," cried Elder Uncle. "We'll take good care of them.""I'll tutor them myself," promised Mr. Huang.I shouted out my thanks, and quickly, far too quickly, they receded into the distance.The fanfare soon faded as we marched out of the city and into the countryside. By afternoon, we were in the mountains and the quiet of the forest. In making their way over the rocky trail, the coolies with their great loads produced a low but constant clatterthe knocking of a multitude of stones one against another.  The rest of us, who carried only small shoulder packs, walked along with relative ease and indulged in private thoughts.Having broken opium addiction and haunted the world, I had, in a way, died and been reborn, only not as an infant, with the freshness of a new day, with a slate wiped clean of memory and regret and disappointment. Rather, I had been reborn an old man, burdened by heartache and nightmare, doubt and misgiving. Things from before assumed a remoteness like perhaps events in a former life. Passions had cooled. Yet at the same time, scenes of the past were most vivid in my mind, coloring, no, rather completely dominating the way I viewed the world. Narcotics had once conjured for me visions of a young revolutionary rising up to help deliver his country from the pestilence of warlords and foreigners. But now, just as I was taking initial steps towards such a reality, I wanted nothing more than to throw off my pack, sit down on the ground and watch the caravan move on without me.In my mind I slipped back to Anshun and the emerald green grandmother, who had fed me milk and opium smoke as a baby.  I witnessed all over again her stunned, horrified expression as she lay there on the bed. Utterly helpless, utterly despairing, both arms outstretched towards me.  In the next moment, the pitiable woman was gone. Disappeared behind a wall. And Grandmother Man-niang was taking me away from my home, the only real home I had ever known as a child, down a hot and parched alleyway, the peasants hoisting our sedan chair pounding the dried mud beneath their bare feet into a trailing cloud of dust. I saw my brother Ming-xu laughing in the sunlight, a broad veil of water droplets leaping into the air behind him as the village fishermen threshed the river with their wide net. I felt the warmth of the sun on our backs, the sweat rolling down the sides of our cheeks. Then, suddenly, Ming-xu was in rags no more but rather a splendid black silk gown. He was practicing his brush strokes at a fine wide desk of polished, varnished wood, and Younger Uncle stood proudly over him, relishing thoughts of a son of eminent future. I saw my dear little brother lying dead and unburied in a roadside ditch at the conclusion of a warlord skirmish outside some unfamiliar village. Lan En-zhang lifted her head and looked into my eyes. "I have unbound my feet," she said with irrepressible glee. "I am learning how to walk again. And when I accomplish this feat, I will race you to the capital. I will run and sprint to my heart's delight. I will cover a distance of five thousand li. I will leap into the air and swallow up distance in great bounds. I will beat you to the gates of the imperial watch tower. I will enter the capital in triumph supreme and joy sublime."I could see every feature of her face. I could almost touch her jet black hair, long and smooth. I could almost sense the warmth of her body. It wasn't that I didn't love her; in fact, I loved her more than anyone else in my entire life, even my little brother. But it was this ... old age, this malaise, which left me distrustful and afraid. Not of her, of course, but of what she could do to me. As if she were a hungry tigress. As if she were a terrible dragon. For how could I possibly endure if one day she should leave me behind as I was now leaving her?"In the capital," I whispered, "we will stroll in summer gardens." As we marched along the rocky trail, I shut my eyes, daring in fantasy what I had never dared in real life: I took her by the hand. My heart ached so badly; I begged it to rend, to release my life's blood, to fell me in my tracks, to kill a young coward so undeserving of anything, to leave me unburied and unmourned on this lonely mountain, to leave me to the wolves and carion eaters.As I marched along I realized that she would learn to walk without me there to catch her when she stumbled.Two Skies     vted mission was to enlist in .

7#$F}rLPWPW`S`S`S`a````aa)a)ax`b- bMf*f`Sfbc ffrx,ffffffChapter 1: Best FriendsChris had warned me about the LA smog, which was frequently so thick that it completely obscured the nearby mountains. On the afternoon of my arrival in Pasadena, however, the San Gabriels loomed large above the low suburban landscape. I parked on the street in front of my friend's ranch house sublet, got out of the Honda and walked up the long driveway, picking a path through the car parts and tools littered about the concrete.  Chris's mind was theoretically inclined, so I assumed that the mechanic of the household was his roommate Roger. I found the side door and knocked. The greeting I got was "Hi.  Neither Roger or I are at home right now," followed by the loud barking of a dog and finally "Down, Fido, down!"I knocked again."Is that someone at the door?" came a voice.The door opened a crack and then a little more, revealing half of Chris's face. In the next moment, my tall, lanky friend was squeezing his way through the narrow passage between the half-open door and kitchen counter. After he got competely out, the door opened all the way, and a short, wiry-looking man with fair skin and sandy hair, Roger I presumed, stepped through with ease.I said, "Whiteman Big Nose," unable to suppress a grin."Chinko Maginko," replied Chris, standing before me barefooted and wearing navy blue gym shorts and a lemon yellow tee-shirt. "I see your face is just as flat as ever.""Five years of sleeping on the side of my head doesn't seem to have done much.""How was the drive?" He reached for pants pockets but found none in which to stick his oversize hands. "You tired?""I'm okay.".He interlaced his fingers and stretched his arms out before him, simultaneously arching his neck backwards and rolling his head from side to side to crack his upper vertebrae. I could hear the muffled snaps. "Take a nap if you want," he yawned. "Plenty of time before dinner.""No thanks," I said. "I'm okay."He put his hands on the backs of his hips and thrust out his chest to crack the sternum. "Do you have a lot of things to bring in?""I've got my sleeping bag and some towels and stuff. Everything else can stay in the car."Apparently finished for the moment with stretching and joint cracking, Chris said, "Okay," and quickly introduced me to Roger. I was rather impressed that he remembered to do this at all. Then the three of us entered the kitchen, where I found no dog but only a large tape player, doubtless with a dog-simulation tape inside, set next to the answering machine.Chris's dwellings have always been interesting places to me.  When he was a graduate student at Yale his New Haven home had been a delinquent Victorian palace that one practically had to tip toe around at all hours of the day and night for fear of agitating one of its more delicate inhabitantsa beautiful but moribund young woman law student plagued by neuroses. This new house was the diametric opposite to the last. There were no closed doors here.  Chris's room was its usual jumble of books, clothes, sports gear and polyethylene jugs filled to varying degrees with mineral spring water.  Roger's gadget-crammed room looked like a mail-order outlet for surplus military electronic equipment. The living room seemed cavernous, perhaps for its paucity of furniture; there was one long sofa, a beat-up armchair and an old TV. That was it. But between the sofa and TV lay the balsa wood parts of a large model airplane strewn like crash wreckage. And unwashed bowls, dishes and silverware occupied part of the shelves of an otherwise bare bookcase recessed into one wall. I perused the scene, stark and whacky, and a strangely familiar feeling of contentment washed over me like the warm waters of a summer shower.After the house tour, Chris and I decided to go for a drive in his Chevy Nova. Roger came along for the ride.  With all four windows rolled down, the rev of the engine and rush of the wind produced a low, constant roar. Tall palms whizzed by in the brilliant mid-afternoon sunlight. Finally, I was in my element, and these were my guys. Within a few blocks, a gleaming red convertible zipped by in the opposite direction with a young man behind the steering wheel and a sexy girl in the passenger's seat, her long golden hair blowing in the wind. I sang out loud and clear, "Now that's living!" but at the same time, I felt a tinge of proletarian revulsion."What do you do?" shouted Roger above the drone of motion."Nothing yet!" I shouted back. "But I've been trying to get into publishing! Editing or writing!""Publishing?" cried Roger. "I thought you had a Ph.D. in something!""Yeah!" I shouted. "Geomorphology!""Geo-mor-what?""Geomor-phology!" I enunciated, squinting in the face of the speed-generated wind. "That's the study of land surface features! Like glaciers and deserts!""Sounds interesting!" he said, head bobbing up and down. "Not really!" I said. "Or maybe it is! But it's a bit too private a pursuit for someone like me!"... Oh really? So what was someone like me like?Roger cupped a hand around one ear and shouted "Private? Did you say private?""Yeah," I cried, "like in totally isolating? Geomorphology: can't see the use of it!"At the top of his lungs, Chris interjected, "Something has to be useful to be worthwhile?!" swinging his head momentarily in my direction."No!" I boomed, shaking my head violently. "Not ... at ... all!"***I wasn't on a Shanghai steamer headed for the front. I wasn't on any misguided mission, directly by any cause but vaguely, politically connected with "the good of the people, the service of the country, the survival of the nation," so on and so forth.Roger nodded vigorously. "I know what you mean!" he shouted. "I work in engineering graphics!""That sounds interesting!""We make images for corporate reports!""Uh huh!""Maybe I should be building washing machines or something instead!" said Roger. "Wish I had something solid to show for a day of work like a washing machine!"I opened my mouth; I tried to find rebuttal; I could find nothing appropriate and reasonable to say."Don't really design them either! Other people do the actual graphics part! I just digitize them!" Roger pretended to type on a PC keyboard. "Get the images into computers! Make them easier to manipulate!""Pretty important stuff!" yelled Chris."Yeah!" shouted Roger. "Sure! Maybe I should become a doctor!""What do they make," I said, my voice breaking. I cleared my throat. "Just money off of their mistakes and other people's suffering.""Of course, they don't make anything!" said Roger at maximum volume, "but you've got to admit, they're undeniably useful!"Ignoring the fact that he'd obviously not heard me, I shouted, "Even though you don't cure sick people or make washing machines, life is still good, right?!" There was no response, verbally or otherwise. Turning to Roger I saw that his focus was trained on some distant point straight ahead of us. I was tempted to wave a hand in front of his eyes. I turned again to Roger. "I mean, life is fun, right?! Your work is challenging; you make decent money! You've got friends and hobbies!""I make good money!" conceded Roger, barely audible above the wind. He squinted and opened his mouth as though for further comment, but speech was arrested. His gaze seemed riveted to the blur of the median strip. He seemed arrested in a sort of mental stasis, like he had suddenly ingested a type of wierd, literally mind-numbing drug. Chris wrenched the steering wheel, and we rounded a corner, speeding towards the foothills of the San Gabriels. I looked to Chris for a sign that his roommate was alright, that I hadn't perhaps offended him, that I hadn't said anything untoward, said something unintentionally harkening back to a sad episode from Roger's past.  Instead, when Chris noticed my attention he shouted, "Roger hasn't been out on a date in six years!"Not what the situation called for. I frowned severely at the buffoon. "Don't really find that many women interesting!" said Roger coming back to life.  "Went out with a woman in my freshman year! But you know how it is at that age!  You're full of hang-ups!""Dave's barely been out on a date in four years!" disclosed Chris."Oh yeah?!" said Roger a little hoarsely but with obvious interest. "Four years?!""I was in Australia!" I defended myself. "I went out every now and then! But as a rule, Australian women aren't that all interested in Asian men!""Man!" cried Roger. "That sucks!"Just then we went by two young women in skimpy athletic gear jogging on the sidewalk. Jiggling as it were. Undulating."BITCHES!" screamed Roger as loud, I imagined, as any human being possibly could."Roger!!!" shouted Chris and I in unison.He turned to us with a predatory, playful look in his eyes. "Women can be such bitches!"After that, conversation stalled. We were soon cruising an affluent foothills ghetto of the upper middle class. Chris stepped on the pedal and yanked the steering wheel from side to side.  The dizzy weave made Roger and I laugh like hyenas.We delivered Roger back to the house by four-thirty so that he could catch the tail end of a model rockets auction in another part of the city.  Chris went back to his work for a while, and I showered and shaved.  In the evening we went to a Vietnamese restaurant in Monterey Park, where we both ordered beef and beef ligament soup noodles and tall, cold glasses of something green. The noodles were truly delectable, but the drinks tasted like, for lack of better description, "grass shakes" mixed with cloying doses of sugar. Because the restaurant people were on a first-name basis with Chris, I did my best to cope with the drink and maintain a pleasant veneer. But finally, I couldn't go on and ordered a Coke.As I sipped my soda and luxuriated in the carbonated wash over my beleaguered palate I thought to myself, "no puppy in my soup, no monkey at this table." I contentedly patted my belly."Hope you didn't mind Roger today," said Chris."Why should I mind?" I poked the ice cubes in my glass with a plastic straw. "Why did he do that? I mean start shouting at those girls and all?""I guess he's frustrated. Obviously, he's not very happy.""Why?"Chris half-frowned and shrugged. "Doesn't like what he's doing? Lonely?""Yeah, sure," I said. "But why? I mean, why is he lonely?""I don't know why. Why is anybody lonely? Because they don't have friends"As one of the waitresses hurried by, she glanced at my nearly untouched grass shake and the can of Coke beside it. Guiltily pushing the soda behind my big noodles bowl to try to obscure it as best I could, I leaned towards Chris and said in a low voice, "You're his friend.""Um," said Chris between long green sips, "I think maybe I'm mainly his housemate.""Don't you want to be his friend?""I have no objection." He shrugged his shoulders again.  "But it doesn't seem to be up to me." Chris manipulated his straw and noisily vacuumed up the last of his grass shake from the bottom of the glass.  "I mean, I like him and all, and we seem to have a good time together, but that's not necessarily the same thing as being true friends.""Like the two of you are friendly but not really 'friends'.""I guess."Scanning the room, I examined the other patronsmostly couples in quiet, reserved conversation. There was also one individual, a bearded man, reading a magazine propped up in front of him against a fat cylindrical sugar dispenser. No parties of rowdy young men and their stylish prostitutes, guffawing at high volume, waving their hands in the air and playing at drinking games. "I think," I quietly confided, "that maybe a lot of my relationships with people are sort of like that.""Well," said Chris. "California's the place for that sort of thing."I said, "Yeah, yeah, I know, I know," the image of pretty Maria flashing through my mind and feeling anxious as though a wide physical chasm might suddenly open up in the ground between the two of us. The San Andreas fault at its most dramatic. "But why aren't the two of you friends? Why is Roger the way he is?""Why so many 'why's'?" Chris shook his head. "I don't know why Roger's Roger. We never talk about it.""To do that," I noted wryly, "you'd have to be friends." Chris chuckled. "About the size of it."***I kept quiet although inside I was aching to hunt for clues to Roger's freakishness. That is, clues to my own freakishness. The bearded man abruptly pushed his chair back away from the table, got to his feet and marched to the cash register, leaving the magazine leaning against the sugar dispenser. Peculiar behavior. That California penchant for aloofness and distance, abandoning dinner companions, even inanimate ones, property, and being unable to commit at the most superficial level. Or was I being peculiar for thinking such? Afterall, just a magazine.Chris fished two ice cubes from his glass with a long spoon and shoveled them into his mouth. "I think ," he said crunching away, "it's got something to do with his parents.""Right," I said with a mild sneer."He's never said so," continued Chris as he popped a third ice cube into his mouth, "but you can tell. I mean, the guy never goes home. His family lives less than two hours away, but he hasn't been back in years.""How do you know he hasn't gone home in years?""Well, he certainly hasn't gone home in the time that I've been around.""You've only been around a few months." "He tells me he hasn't gone home in years," said Chris, "and why should he lie?"I shook my head. "It's so fashionable these days, blaming your parents. Just look at the Hollywood stars. I mean, his parents may have something to do with his problems and all, but in the end, if he can't work things out for himself, who's going to suffer? That's the bottom line, isn't it? The really guilty party is himself."Chris muttered, "Right, right, right," all but dismissing my clich."Who else is there to blame?!"Coolly, the young physicist observed, "It's a crowded world. It's not like it used to be when our parents were our age and maybe there was still a bit of ...  'space'. Like maybe at one time Roger wanted to be something special, but after a while he figured out that he really didn't stand a chance. He wasn't smart enough, or maybe opportunities were just too scarce. See what I mean?" My friend looked down at his empty glass, still sweaty with condensation, then shifted his attention to a couple of crusty fortune cookies in a shallow porcelain dish. He picked one up and cracked it between his fingers. I noticed an acceleration in my breathing and tried to slow it down. "Then why not blame the world?""Because it's easier to blame our parents." He tossed a shard of fortune cookie into his mouth.With an air of pseudo-intellectual superiority, I pronounced, "Simplistic."Chris countered with a shrug. "Look. If the world's our problem, then there's nothing we can do about it.""Out of our hands. Hopeless."***A sly grin arched across his face. "You got it. But if the problem is ourselves, we could still do something about it, and that would require effort as well as risk. Because what if you try to do something about thing, try to make things better for yourself, and you fail?  What if you keep trying but keep failing? Then maybe there is something really wrong with you. Maybe it proves there's something missing." With a loosely closed fist, Whiteman Bignose thumbed his chest. "And who wants to face that?" Chris pushed the rest of the fortune cookie into his mouth. "It's a lot easier just pinning things on your folks. If you try and fail, then it can be their fault. Your parents didn't do the right things raising you or try hard enough.  They fucked up, not you."***My blood rose. Like mercury in a thermometer. Beneath a blazing sun. "It's like we're still little babies learning to walk," I said. "And we need them to hold us up," I said."I guess."Our waitress, a slim young woman with jet black hair that hung down to the middle of her back, approached us with a smile. She gently laid the bill face down upon the table. "Was everything alright?" she asked, a trace of southeast Asian accent in her voice."Great," said Chris. "Thanks.""Would you like anything else?""Not me," said Chris. "How about you, Dave?""No, I'm fine. Thanks. Great noodles."Nodding appreciatively, the girl turned and walked away.Immediately, I leaned forward again and said, "Maybe the only 'special' thing Roger really ever had in mind was getting a satisfying job and finding a girlfriend.""Maybe.""Maybe Roger's gay and just can't cope with it. Or maybe he's claustrophobic, and he's forced to stay in a tiny office cubical all day long.""Look," said Chris raising his hands in mild but helpless despair, "I could be way off about Roger, but whatever his real problem, if he connects it to his parents then it still puts them in the middle of the picture." He lifted the shallow dish and sucked the second fortune cookie directly into his mouth. He started reexamining the menu as though planning to order another meal.  After a while he put the menu down and spat out the tiny strip of fortune cookie paper, sopping but legible. He glanced at his fate and tossed it aside. He reached for the dry fortune strip among the crumbs and read that too. Then he looked down and wrapped his long fingers around his empty glass.  I thought back to high school when his features were perhaps not quite so angular and he talked about becoming the next Niels Bohr or Albert Einstein.

7#$bflhlh}!}!}!}/}}}}~~'~'~x}+ K*}!a Chapter 2: My OpiateOnce upon a time, there lived a boy who fantasized about riding a beam of light. And when that boy grew up, he solved the riddle of light.  The knowledge he created curved space and time; it warped humanity by detonating a bomb that vaporized many gods. The universe of human knowledge exploded, and individual achievement was atomized. Single breakthroughs no longer played with the fabric of creation or even shattered the world.  Science and technology rode a smooth upward curve produced by the collective effort of a myriad of workersthe ants of a global ant heap.  Small wonder that my childhood friend had relegated himself to a backwater of his field.  It was a concession to the fact that neither he nor any other physicist could ever again hope to produce anything so powerful, so lucid, so beautiful as the insight of the boy dreamer Einstein. Sitting there in the darkened theater before its glowing screen, I mocked the critics with their claims of 'unprecedented'.  There was nothing novel about the film we were watching; it had all premiered before. And what of art, and what of music? 'New Wave'. Same old, same old. Everything was repeating. Progress had pushed beyond man's capacity to generate 'newness'. Opportunities for greatness weren't merely rare, they were non-existent!I forced myself not to ball my fingers into fists or clutch the ends of the armrests.  I severed my limbs from my passion, for why should I care? Those damned, debilitating childhood tales, stories of a revolution that the teller knew full well were bankrupt. And who was I kidding? After fleeing to Australia and now California, putting as much distance as possible between me and the old man, I was still no more free to flout ambition than a dog is to control instinct?The movie faded into white as a bright curtain of doubt fell over my eyes. But what was my underlying ambition? To serve, to contribute, to achieve? Or merely to top him? Such absurdity! Absurdity had chased me into the furnace heart of the desert, a place he had not gone, a feat and exploit he could never match.The theater was packed, but I was quite alone and lost in the wilderness of self-doubt.On the long drive home, Chris remarked on how little I had brought with me."I guess," I said, "I was pretty anxious to get away on vacation. Most of my stuff is still at my sister's."We passed by a long line of closed shops, gone out of business. Their soaped-over windows hid empty interiors. For a minute or so, Chris searched the air waves for a decent tune, but then he gave it up, switching off the radio. "Remember back in high school?" he said. "When we used to wish for a tragedy?""What do you mean?" I said. "Like a war or death in the family?"He chuckled awkwardly. "Yeah.""Something disastrous but just short of personal bodily harm.""Yeah," he repeated.To bring us out of our coma. "I remember.""I guess you don't wish it anymore, huh?""No," I said, and for a long moment my answer seemed to lie between us like a red-hot coin. But finally, I resumed, "Do you?" "No, no!" he responded quickly, adding with strange urgency, "Is this too much air for you? Do you want me to roll up my window?""I'm fine."I closed my eyes and took a deep, silent breath. The darkness faded, and I pictured again that spring day, so blue and bright. It was the second semester of my junior year in college. I was at the library between classes, leafing through magazines. I flipped a page in the normally innocuous National Geographics, and there before my eyes was the photograph of a little girlskin-covered skull with bulging eyes, barred teeth and sparse strands of parched, crooked hair.  I'd seen portraits from the famine in North Africa before, but for some reason this particular shot had more than the usual effect.  Never before had it even crossed my mind to post a small donation, yet suddenly those sunken eyes, devoid even of despair, branded my soul. I wanted to put food into that little girl's hands, create for her a whole new childhood, one without pain or want. One in which she could play and be frivolous, mischevious, happy and normal. Such was the power of the opium on which my father had weaned me that the onset of hallucination bore the force of self-discovery and revelation. That spring day in the quiet of a library reading room, a seed planted in early childhood germinated in the turning of a page, the blink of an eye. The wished-for tragedy had struck. My long-dormant heart erupted. The urge overcame me to contribute not merely money but my life.Over two thousand years ago the great scholar Li Bing warred against a river. He swore not to return home until he had tamed the Min, killer of tens of thousands, harnessed its flood waters for the benefit of his people. For three decades he kept his distance, and in the end he also kept his promise.  Li Bing broke the river's siege with a system of dams and moveable channel deflectors in use to this day. The subservient waters of the Min made Sichuan a veritable paradise on earth.I too left my family, and off to Australia I flew, swearing to stay in academic exile until I brought back not necessarily a Ph.D. but the secrets of the desert with which to break its power. Perhaps I could do something of value for that starving sliver of millions unlucky enough to find themselves before the Saharan tide of advancing dunes.I shook my head until it hurt, but I could not rid myself of the pain. The sheer arrogance and stupidity. A boy in a library, seeing the suffering of the world through a glossy magazine photograph. A conceit of phenomenal proportions. I had never known a day of duress or hunger or want in all my life. Childhood and youth had been a long unbroken draw of comfort and ease and supreme good fortune. Rendering revolutionary zeal an utter perversity. My godlike ambition was a mirthless joke, a misfunction, a disease. Here was a discombobulated member of the ant heap. I was suddenly ashamed. More deeply ashamed and embarassed than I had ever been before. I could not have been more so had I wet my pants and puddled the car seat."What's wrong?" said Chris with a chuckle."Nothing," I said. "Oh," said Chris with what I took to be an air of suspicion. "When I left my sister's house this morning I forgot to ... put something away in the frig.""Oh," came Chris again, with a nod. "Well, won't she put it away for you?""I don't think it's anywhere anybody can find.""But they'll find it eventually," reassured my friend, "when it starts to reek.""Oh, that's good," I said with a grin. "It already reeks."***In my mind's eye I watched the young hitchhikersky diver extraodinaire. He was wearing a khaki green jump suit. He was checking his strapes, behind him the interior green ribbing of a huge military transport.  The back bay hatch very slowly yawned open, accompanied by the sound of hydralic arms. The grinning young man with curly hair put an antiquated WWII leather skull cap over his head. He gave me a thumbs up with such confidence and force that I felt I could almost feel the tension in his biceps. Casually, he walked up to the lip of the opened, level hatch. He turned around; his smile grew wider. He waved at megoodbye. He crossed his arms over his chest. He leaned backwards. And away he fell.We stopped at a red light, and Chris signaled to turn right. We rounded the corner and drove past a highway sign for Pasadena."I've got a new girlfriend," said Chris."Really?" I said. "Really."I watched two stop signs glide by without making further remark, but then said, "So ...  what's she like?"Chris cleared his throat. "Well ... she's no supermodel or anything."No comment."And she's not a hard hat either." An allusion to a recent former girlfriend who had worked as a lineman for the telephone company.  "Does she," I said, "stick you with pins and needles on Saturday nights?""No," said Chris with a chuckle. "She's not another acupuncturist.""Well then?""An anthropologist," he said. "An assistant professor."I craned my neck and looked out the windshield, trying to make out the starry sky beyond the glare of street lamps and pink urban glow. "Intellectually compatible.""You want to know what she looks like?"I humored my friend, "Sure.""Well," began Chris. "Let's see? She's got this big nose and glasses."I made two "o's" with my fingers and peered through them as though through a couple of monocles. Chris, grinning like a skull, pushed the steering wheel with straight arms as his back curved under the strain of suppressed laughter. "What else?" I asked.He passed a hand over his mid-section and said, "She's got this ... round belly."With Herculean effort I squeezed out "voluptuous" without cracking a smile."Voluptuous is great," pronounced Chris, "but if you add a few pounds here, a few pounds there...." The chuckles started hissing out like steam in a leaky pressure cooker.I cracked a chuckle. "Is she starting to chub out or something?" "Not as long as I keep eating her food for her." "What?" "Off of her plate. A spoonful here, a spoonful there. I think she's getting suspicious. I catch her trying to sneak out at nights to buy candy and ice cream at the corner store. Don't know how much longer I can keep this up; I'm really starting to put on weight." Chris patted his stomach and broke into peals of hiccuping laughter, and I too was overcome by convulsions.  Chris, laughing while driving and able only to snatch glimpses of the mute gestures with which I tried to signal comic distress, blurted out in staccato cadence, "What, what, what, what?!"We slowed to a crawl, lucky that there was a passing lane next to ours. After several minutes, we were able to stop laughing, sparing our aching ribs. And the car picked up speed again. Even so, we were still no good for speech; it was another five minutes before we were both proof against relapse. When conversation resumed, it was once more in guarded tones."Her name?" I asked."Karin," said Chris.In the tenderness of his voice, I could tell how my friend truly saw this new love.  He told me that the two of them went for walks and talked for miles.  They went dancing and out to movies. In the evenings before going to sleep, they read to each other.  I said, "I guess I'll soon be getting an invitation to Thanksgiving dinner." Chris began to laugh again but this time softly.  I contemplated their happy nestmy future holiday refuge from the slings of bachelor solitude. My best friend would soon possess exactly what I most coveteda real and normal life.The sky diver flies through the air, arms spread out to either side of him like a vulture with featherless, useless wings. Nevertheless, he smiles. The wind flutters his hair protruding out from the rims of his leather skull cap at a terrific rate. The wind makes an impression upon his face, pushing in the cheeks, working his lips around like a ring of jello. He falls through vapora cloud. Cold moisture buffets his face and his exposed hands, his body through the meager insulation of the jump suit. Where is the sun? Behind and above him. Where is the earth? Directly below.A parachute blossoms above the sky diver and fills with air. Nylon straps jerk up against the metal catches on the sky diver's suit, jerks up against the weight of his free-fall body. A bit of wind is knocked out of him. But he keeps on smiling. He can't help himself. He loves this thing he's doing. He floats down, down, down, down. More slowly and gradually than a drive through urban/suburban LA. What country is this? Where the roof tops smolder and still bodies of animals and people litter the ground?He lands on soft, almost yielding dust. Black smoke rises lazily from a nearby pagoda. There is in his nostrils a strange mixture of smellssrping flowers, faint temple incense, charred flesh. The man is no longer in the sky. The parachute falls to the ground, limp, flat. Not a breeze stirs it. He pinches metal latches, and the nylon straps fall one after another making silent impact on the dusty surface. The sky diver, still trying to maintain a smile, looks around him. He is thinking, "Where am I?" He is thinking, "What the hell is going on here?"I am thinking, "This is China. This is war. This is your chance to do something. Of value."I walk up to the lad. He turns to me. He seems to recognize me; a flicker of relief momentarily seems to relax that taxed, strained smile. He gives the smile up entirely. His jaw drops open.I say nothing to him. For nothing needs to be said. I begin to walk. He follows. I guide him through the field of burnt crop stubble.  I step over a body, not bothering to weave around it. He does the same, casting a look of aghast curiosity down upon the poor peasant woman underfoot. We leave her behind. I wonder does the young American know what the ancient say about the unburied and unmourned? I wonder should I tell him? Should I instruct him to help me dig for this woman a hole, a long narrow bed of uncovered earth? We walk on.What thing of value do I expect that this young American will be able to do? Win the war? Stop the fighting? Save a life? Expectations run high. But without cause or grounds for optimism. Pure fiction. A dream. As divorced from reality as a shimmering mirage in the desert wastes. With no more substance or solidity than the thought of a rock, the thought of piece of paper, the thought of victory, the thought of peace.But then again, aren't the two of us visitors from the future? Not imprisoned by that which has already transpired? Do we not have the option of opting out. Are we not like people coming out of the theater after watching a vivid film, still walking around in the movie, waiting for it to fade away and the streets of normalcy to reassert themselves on our consciousness? There is a breeze, which stiffens into a brisk wind. The parachute, lying there on the ground, seems to come back to life, like a jellyfish of the land. It rises and falls, rises and falls. It moves laterally a bit. Away from us. To one side. But then it rises  once more, not to fall again. And then it is no longer behind us, at a small distance. Rather, it is inexplicably reattached to nylon straps attached to us. The parachute exerts a tug that we can feel in every part of the body. The young American smiles. The parachute lifts into the sky, taking us along with it. The air chills. The air clears. Away with ashy smoke and the smell of burnt and rotting flesh. Away with blood soaked earth and starving, cold children, homeless, parentless children. We fly up, like birds without wings, like atoms of gas, like photons of light. Up, up, up, up. The simple vocabulary of Seus. Zeus. Seus.A car security system started beeping and blaring. I opened my eyes. I sat up in the car seat. I looked around. I was where I was and nowhere else."What do you make of this place?" I heard myself saying in a voice slurry from broken sleep.  Chris looked left then right at the strip malls to either side. He asked, "Did you fall alseep or something?""Or something. What do you make of this place?" "What do you mean?" I followed a pair of cars as they passed in the neighboring lane and slowly shrank moving down the road ahead of us. "The country," I elaborated. "This American society.""Oooh," he said knowingly.I ground my teeth as drops of sweat slid down the sides of my cheeks and drops of poison trickled down my throat. "Our lives," I couldn't help myself saying in my mind, "so soft and easy. Pulpy." You begin to float and drift. You get carried along by this current of routine and comfort. An absence of gravity. Zero ground. Nothing to push against. No resistance. Your muscles turn to peanut butter, your bones to brittle. Balance is impossible, but there's absolutely no danger of falling. 'Why can't we have a disaster?' you bleat. 'Why can't we have a war?'"I'm going to settle down and become an academic,"  announced Chris."Sounds like a plan," I said."What's wrong with being a professor, right?""Right. Absolutely. Nothing wrong with it at all.""Absolutely.""You're not going to have any trouble," I said, "getting tenured at some university.""You make it sound like getting fixed. Like a cat." He chuckled. "Then it will be teaching and research, research and teaching. Semester after semester, year in and year out.  The next thing you know, there's going to be this white-haired professor sitting at my desk and sleeping in my bed....  And a good thing too. Remember last month when I wanted to be a science writer? Remember last year when I wanted to join the anti-nuclear underground and infiltrate some major defense industry company? Remember waaay back when when I actually wanted to be a ... I don't know.""Fuck off!" were the words I wanted to hear myself say. "Fuck ... the hell ... off!" But instead, I said nothing at all for what seemed hours but was merely seconds. One more cars streaked past us and moved down the road to became coupled points of red light. "How many people," he quietly asked, "do you think read the stuff I publish?""What do you mean?""Maybe a dozen per article?" he estimated.  "Half a dozen?"Rubbing my eyes wearily, I said with only faint sarcasm, "Publishing articles serves its own purpose. How else would you build a resume? How else would you land a decent university job and get tenured?"Chris took both hands off the steering wheel and clapped once in applause before hooking the bottom of the wheel with a finger to insure that our straight course down the road was not rudely disrupted by a sign post or scrawny southern Cal tree. "You know," he said wistfully, "I used to get excited about ideas. Really excited.""Look," I said. "Those were school days. We used to learn cool things all the time, like relativity and whatnot, but school's not real life." I shook my head. "This is real life. Career. Stability. Nine-to-five. Family. Home. Happiness. Right?"Chris said, "I went down into the catacombs in Paris last summer. Have you ever been in the catacombs? Do you even know what they are?""I think I've heard of them," I said. "I think I remember what they are?"Chris could have said, "Okay then, what are they?" But instead, he said, "They're like this system of sewers, but there's no water or sewage. You go down these stairs; I mean, its underground and all. Then you enter these narrow little tunnels. Long, long, narrow little tunnels. And the walls of these tunnels, they're like ... I don't know, like lined by thousands and thousands and thousands of skulls. All stacked up, you see. Miles of them. You look into a hundred thousand pairs of empty eye sockets. So many that you almost stop noticing that they're eye sockets in skulls. Who were any of these people anyways?""Butchers, bakers""Candle stick makers." Chris chuckled. "And professsors. Lots of professors.""Maybe not a lot....""You're like lying on your bed in the hotel and suddenly you realize, 'Hey ... I'm one of those skulls.'""Oh come on," I said with a chuckle. "You afraid of dying or something? Hey, we haven't even retired yet." As I turned to my friend, I noticed a tear in the corner of his eye."Not afraid of dying," he said. "More like not really ever living."   His clich had the force of a sledge; it knocked the wind out me, figuratively. For I couldn't say another word. The darkened shops were indescribably oppressive. Unable to guess our position or reckon how much longer the ride would last, I endured every moment with the voiceless agony of a man lost in the barren wilderness, lost on a vast white salt flat, nowhere to hide from the blindingly white eye of the all-seeing sun.The last part of our homeward journey wasn't completely devoid of conversation, but the exchange was terse and lifeless. As we pulled into the driveway and parked, I rehearsed once more in my mind a contrite expression of admiration and envy. Chris was sooo lucky!... Patronizing? Perhaps. But I decided to offer the bromide anyways. We got out of the car and walked to the kitchen doormy cue. I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. More of the usual.Upon entering, Chris took a jug of mineral spring water out of the refrigerator and lugged it to his room while I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth.Splashing my face, I weighed the best options for saying goodnight.  I dried myself with a towel and exited.  I walked past Chris's room and glanced inside. He was standing in front of his mattress on the floor, reading a book while dangling a jug of water from his hand and rolling a basketball beneath his bare foot.  I went by without uttering a sound but then stopped briefly in the hallway to say, "I left the lights on in the bathroom for you.""Okay," he said. "Thanks."I entered the big living room and, not bothering to switch on the lights, began immediately to busy myself at my encampment.  As I threw sofa cushions onto the carpet, I heard Chris shuffle out of his room and into the bathroom. It didn't take me long to unroll my sleeping bag and change clothes. I lay down on my makeshift bed and rested my arms beneath my head.How uniformly dark were the shadows on the walls and ceiling. I shut my eyes and listened.  The night was filled with a ringing echo: nitrogen molecules, someone had once told me. That's all that was, nitrogen molecules.Footsteps brushed the carpet. I cocked my head and looked up. Chris's form obscured the bathroom light at the end of the hall, creating a halo around the silhouette of his head."What is it?" I asked.Looking around at my scattered things he said, "It's too bad you didn't bring more stuff.""Why?""Because now you have no choice but to go back.""Of course.""Yeah, but what if you decided to look for a job around here?"My eyes adjusted relatively quickly to the contrast so that I could make out his features again. I propped myself up by an elbow.  "You mean it?""Sure," he said. "It's up to you. I mean, it's your  decision."Unable to hold his unseen gaze, I dropped my eyes. "A free country and all.""What's so good up north that you can't leave it?""Nothing." "Anyways," he concluded, turning to go, "it's at least something to think about."As he disappeared into his room, I called out, "Chris?" He popped his head out the door, and I said, "Thanks." "Um well," he replied. "This isn't really something you should thank me for.""Yeah, I know. Free country.""Right.""But thanks anyways."By the time we went to sleep it was very late. Although I had had nothing more to drink since dinner, I got up repeatedly for hours. Chris, on the other hand, didn't emerge once from his room, but twice passing by his door on my way to the comode I heard him gulping from his jug of water. In the morning Chris slept through his alarm.  When I finally woke him, he practically leapt out of bed. A few minutes later, he dashed through the kitchen, tossing the sandwiches I had made and wrapped for him into a giant Hefty's trash bag. With the dark green trash bag slung over a shoulder, he ran out the door before I could nail him with a rubber band.After a few more days, I left for the Bay Area. The plan was for me to retrieve my things and get back to LA as soon as possible. There were plenty of publishing interests around with which I could lodge applications. Riding the highway I felt light as the breeze.  The old, corrupting illusions were gone, vanquished like ghosts with the rising sun.  Certain, this life belonged to me, and I would live it on my own terms. Leaning against the car door to catch the wind in my face, I started to howl and bark at the sun. This dog had snapped its leash. "Piss on instinct!"  A threshold to adventure beckoned me, and the adventure would be wonderfully mundane.  At long last, I was on my way to a normal life.As I drove along the shore, I watched a platoon of hungry gulls patrolling the beach. Four scouts hovered above the sand, another three above the frothy Pacific surf. Deep gulps of sea air filled my lungs, filled my body with energy and hope. It suddenly struck me as both curious and quaint that Father had once been as enamored of the technological wonders of the West as I was presently fascinated by the depredations of old China. In a mood of clemency, without a care in the world, I turned on the tape player to continue the journey of the young revolutionary.  This time the sound of the old man's voice made me anxious for story time, like a little kid again. The war, a revolution really, was at long last over. Not only had I survived, but I had won.Two Skies     vhshadow-hiddenhere was nothing novel about thiss packed, but I was quite alone in the wilderness in the way of luggageir waves for a decent tune, butsoon a red-hot coin.

7#$;ClD@KDWDWVVVV#XWXWXWXcXXXY!xVY Y]*^V]Y ]]l,]]]]]]Chapter 3: A Young Rabble RouserThe Shanghai I found fairly hummed with commercial activity.  The only hint that war and massacre had overtaken the city were the Nationalist patrols that strolled the streets and boulevards.  From newspapers I learned that my fellow former runt and now exceedingly accomplished cousin Xu-hai, Elder Uncle's eldest son, was commander of the city garrison. So I went to see him at army headquarters. After a warm reunion, he invited me to join his staff, and I, of course, accepted.For the next week and a half, I tried to make myself useful in what ways I couldrepairing equipment, moving furniture, taking inventory, etc. My cousin was shifting his headquarters into a permanent residence, so there was much need for custodial attention. One day a dispatch arrived ordering his forces to Long Tan to guard the Yangtze embankment at the mighty river's easiest crossing.  The garrison marched out of the city, and I was left to my own devices.In Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek had established a Nationalist government to rival Wang Jing-wei's "illegitimate" one in Wuhan. Hence, to Nanjing I went seeking a useful role in my country's future. My first preference was to enroll in a technical college, where I could study mathematics and learn to become an engineer.  Without funds, however, this was a somewhat demoralizing pipe dream. Fortuitously, General Chiang had recently founded in his new capital the Nationalist Party Central School for Cadres. Here one could study politics and finance, learn to become a party officer. I applied for admission and found the entrance exam child's play.  Offered a place on the rolls, full financial support and party membership, again I accepted.My future classmates and I had barely the time to unpack and settle into barracks when news arrived that my cousin's forces at Long Tan had been routed.  Sun Chuan-fang, the Warlord of Five Provinces, was now on our side of the Yangtze and poised to take Nanjing, which had previously been his seat of power.  The school was thrown into panic. Most of the cadets joined with thousands of local residents in a hasty westward retreat.  Those of us without funds for travel ... or deep concern for our lives ...  stayed in our barracks and awaited the turn of events. As fate would have it, General Bai Chong-xi of Guangxi province, the Nationalist army's chief-of-staff, arrived at Long Tan the very next day, and his forces drove Li back across the river. Apparently, I would live to salute my headmaster the good General Chiang.The Communist counteroffensive began on the first of August with an uprising in Nanchang the capital of Jiangxi province. This and the subsequent "Autumn Harvest" revolt in several central provinces were successfully suppressed by the Nationalists.  In December, the Communists ransacked Canton, briefly capturing the important southern entrepot, but the Nationalists quickly regained the city with much slaughter.Clearly, "for the people" didn't necessarily mean very much to the other side either when it came to a contest for supremacy.  Despite my sneaking kinship with the Communists, I now wished for their swift and final defeat.  Only then, I reasoned, could the work of peace time and reconstruction finally really commence. In this sentiment, I felt a traitor to my mentor Schoolmaster Ho, the eloquent Mr. Huang and Elder Uncle, dedicated socialists all. They had invested in a young revolutionary, not a turncoat, not a ... "nothing".  Worst of all, in exchange for this hypocrisy of insignificance, I had surrendered something real and inestimable in valuethe love of Lan En-zhang. Since my departure from the mountains, I had yet to write her once. For how could I? An utter failure with less than nothing to offer? Whatever deeds I might have done in the past to win her esteem and affection seemed distant and forfeit. Why should she want me? Why would she wait for me? The academy's weekly assembly of students and faculty offered a convenient opportunity for purging disappointment and venting anger. I took sides in every debate and became a lightening rod for controversy.  The academy's dean of student affairs regularly arrived five to ten minutes late, so beginning in October, when our bloody General Chiang formally proclaimed a new "legitimate" government of the Republic of China, our tardy dean became the target for my attacks."What special privilege," I railed before the assembly, "is Dean Gu entitled to simply by virtue of rank and title? He is, afterall, the academy's director of ideology.  He should be the last person to violate the very protocol he helped establish. Believe me, Brothers, he wasn't always a party senior. He was once a young man just like us. When I close my eyes, I see a boy in the very mountains of my childhood. I see a boy in the library of my uncle's house. It was, in fact, there that he learned the three principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen'nationalism' 'equality' and 'socialism'! These are ideas that we stand for, and we stand for them because we are true party members!  We are true party members because we are brothers! There is no room in the party for elitists."At one meeting, after my usual tirade, I proposed to have Dean Gu stand at attention upon arrival, one minute for every minute late. The motion was quickly seconded. Following fast on this (and over the loud opposition of the faculty members on hand) it was passed.  The good dean, wearing his smart military jacket, arrived past schedule as usual.  But this time, before he could take his central seat among the senior administrators on stage, the student marshals blocked his way and informed him that latecomers were to stand in the aisle and await formal permission to assume their places. What a sight his red face! Like a beet plucked up out of the ground. And much to my greater amazement, he did exactly as told!The next week, our dean was absent again at the opening of assembly. So I floated my proposal a second time. As before, it won overwhelming approval.  When Dean Gu arrived, the same penalty was exacted.  He abided once more, and on the morning following, I was summoned to his office."I understand that you are the one who leads the assembly in rebellion," said Dean Gu almost as I entered the room."No," I answered, walking up to his desk and snapping to attention. "It is no rebellion.  It is simply holding every member of the assembly accountable to the standards of the academy."He considered me but briefly from his chair. He asked me, "Are you a Communist?"I answered truthfully, "No.""Then why do you make trouble?""No trouble at all."He studied me carefully, grinning at my impudence. I let my eyes wander, examining his office, which was quite tastefully decorated with tall scrolls of black-ink calligraphy hanging on the walls. There were large ceramic vases with flowers of light purple and pink. There was a dark wood bookcase, and the books were behind glass! I have never before seen such a thing."Nor would it be any trouble," he suggested slowly, "for me to have you arrested."I looked back to Dean Gu. This time, I laid off. Dean Gu observed, "You enjoy making trouble.""No."Calmly he continued, "From the way you shoot off your cannon mouth, it's obvious you relish the rabble rouser's role. Do you think that your fellow cadets find these adolescent pyrotechnics as amusing as you seem to?""I'm sure I don't know." "I'm sure that some do, but some must find them tiresome.  As well as totally pointless."I was trying my best to look detached, but his rebuke stung, which I hadn't expected. Much more than that, I was scared."I think you are a Communist, Mr. Zhou. And if I were to prove it, you would be a very unhappy fellow indeed. I assume you are fond of your head.""It can't be proved!" I said. "Because it isn't true!"The dean, a slight, birdlike man with the steady eyes of an eagle, reached across his chest and scratched at the side of his neck as though trying to rid himself of fleas. "Actually, my mere suspicion would be sufficient grounds for expulsion. You are certainly a sympathizer. Whether there are actual written documents to prove the point or not. Did you know that I could do have you expelled with a few strokes of my brush? Expunged from the rolls. Erased from respectable society. Forever."I said nothing.Knitting his brows, his stare bore into me eyes. He asked again, "Did you know that?"Quite properly cowed, I responded, "No."Dean Gu allowed a brief interval to pass in silence though I hardly needed the extra time to appreciate my precarious situation. His sardonic grin faded. The man resumed softly, "We are a long ways from Guizhou, you and I. There are very few of us out here beyond the confines of our mountain home. Yet in the revolution, we are many. The mountains seem to breed rebels." He paused again; I held myself at attention, this time not daring to allow my eyes to wander.Dean Gu said almost solemnly, "Your elder uncle was the best teacher I ever had. He didn't have to bother with me or any other no-account boy; he taught us in his spare time. It was a contribution to society."I looked down, no longer able to hold his eyes. Indeed, I felt as small as a beetle. As small as a tick on the back of a rat.Dean Gu suddenly chuckled, perhaps at the aspect of my broken spirit. "Your uncle built things up; he didn't tear them down. That's the sign of a genuine revolutionary!  Do you know the meaning of the word?""My uncle," I conceded, "was a good man.""In deference to him," said the dean, "I let you go. This time. But be warned. One more incident, and I will exercise my authority to the fullest. Make no mistake.""Yes," I said.He dismissed me with a curt "good-bye."At the very next assembly, Dean Gu was late as usual, and unfathomably, even to myself, even to this very day, I advanced my standard proposal. As always, it passed.  Was I genuinely politically offended by Dean Gu's cavalier behavior. Possibly yes. Possibly no. When finally Dean Gu arrived, the customary punishment awaited him. Within an hour after the adjournment of assembly, I was called to the office of Dean Gu's secretary, who informed me of my expulsion.  The vacancy of my bed would be required by the end of the school day.I packed my few possessions. I said goodbye to my few friends. I left the academy grounds well before dinner. Near the center of the city, I found a small boarding house where I became one of twenty paying guests, mainly rickshaw runners, crowded into a single narrow room with floorboards so coarse that they filled my cloth shoe soles with splinters and a ceiling so low that I walked about stooped over for fear of scraping my head. The air was suffocating with the acrid stink of sweat, and if you could sleep through the odor, the snores and hacking coughs, you awoke in the mornings covered with bedbug bites, itchy and red. If only Elder Uncle could see me now! After in a way predicting this outcome all those many years ago in a dark hospital laboratory stocked with jars of preserved human parts, I had at last arrived at the threshold of a grim fate.I had to escape before my money ran out, before I began to slide down that long steep chute. I had to find a job, something clerical perhaps, something menial. But at the same time, I couldn't quite give up on the idea of the academy.  It simply represented too much: an education and a chance yet to serve the country. One night, in the thralls of desperation, I determined to seek out my former headmaster.An hour before dawn, I was already outside the mansion of General Chiang Kai-shek. My lonely presence immediately caught the attention of the guard at the gate.  When he called out to me, I obediently walked over. It didn't take much prompting on his part to extract my sad, unruly tale. When I was done, the soldier, a boy probably even younger than myself by the looks of him, directed me to a spot by the side of the road where I might be more plainly visible from the back seat of a car. After two hours more, a staff limousine appeared just as the soldier had predicted. It sped past me without slowing.  The rear-seat passenger had a mustache and shaved head that rose to a rounded peak. General Chiang.At dawn the next day I was back at my roadside post. Once more I stood sentinel until the passing of the staff car.  This exercise was repeated a third, fourth and fifth time until on the sixth morning the staff car finally stopped before me.  The door opened, and General Chiang peered out.  "You stand here every morning," he said."Yes," I answered respectfully, bowing quickly then snapping to attention."Why?" he asked."Because you are the chancellor of my school, and I have been expelled. I would like to be considered for readmittance." General Chiang looked me over from head to toe. Every Monday after his address to the jointly assembled students of our political school and Whampao Military Academy, roll was called, and each cadet stepped out of his file for the general's inspection.  Was it possible that he actually recognized me?"This is, this is, this is," he said, "a trivial matter. You obviously deserved expulsion." I thought to say, "I violated nothing," but for once held my tongue and nodded in agreement, careful not to look the general in the eye."However," he continued, "you're well spoken.  You're tenacious and perhaps even brave.  Listen here.  I'm picking up where I left off, and this time, I'm not going to stop until I've taken back the whole country.  That is, that is, that is to say I need good junior officers.  Understand?""But what about school?""Never mind school!" shouted the general, dismissing my notion with a wave of his white-gloved hand.  "The school's closing anyways! What need is there for an academy when there's a war to be fought?! If you go back there now, you'll find empty barracks.  All your mates will be with me.  Marching north! Besides, if you acquit yourself well in the campaign, you'll get something out of it.  Something worthwhile. I'll see to that.""Sir," I said bowing again, "I would be honored to serve in your ranks. But if I live, may I return to the academy? Assuming it reopens.""Yes, yes, yes!" said the general knitting his brow. "It will reopen, it will reopen!  You may have your diploma, if you live. But you will get nothing at all unless you report today to Mr.  Chen.  Know who I'm talking about?""Yes," I said."Good.""But please understand me, sir," I hurriedly added, "it isn't a diploma I want.  It's an education."The general smirked. "Very well, very well, very well. Now don't let me see you here again.""Yes!" I said, bowing a third time. "Yes, yes!"The car door swung shut, and the staff car pulled away.Two Skies     vWas I afraid of my superior; was I truly aware of what he could do to me?

Our function was to promote "territorial consolidation".  Our method was to follow closely behind the front line forces and indoctrinate the peasants in newly conquered territory.  The army gathered in February when the wind was as sharp as icicles.  Unlike most of my comrades, I had brought almost nothing with me, not even a blanket. Luckily, an older man named Cui let me share his sheepskin cover.  This was fine during the cold weather, but by April we had put away our padded jackets and the amount of water I drank during the days caused me to get up several times every night.  Worse than that, I started to snore, and now that we slept with our shoes off, my socks stank.  Old Cui asked me to find someone else with whom to share a cover, but I asked him just how I was supposed to do that when he complained so loudly? My reputation was shot. And the nights were still too cold to sleep out in the open! So the square-jawed Cui persevered as my benefactor.In the first weeks of the campaign morale was high.  We heard many stories of peasants by the roadside greeting our soldiers on the march with gifts of food. On occasion we received such gifts ourselves--steamed buns mostly. As for our work, it was easy enough.  We haunted restaurants and markets, exploiting every chance to explain the plight of the common people, to extol the revolution and to expound Sun Yat-sen's three principles. The crowds gathered to listen and then melted away before we could finish. When we were accompanied by armed soldiers, audience dissipation proceeded at a slightly slower rate.One market day in a village in Anhui province, a willowy young man named Shi took his turn on the makeshift speaker's stand, a wooden table. Cui and I stood to either side of him in front of the table.  A relatively large crowd of perhaps forty or fifty peasants had gathered, which I attributed to the fine resonance of Shi's voice and the great passion of his oratory. I, of course, paid scant attention since I had heard it all before. The rally merely presented me a chance to daydream. And on this morning I stood on board an ocean steamer plying though the waves. Lan En-zhang and I were sailing for America, where we would live in perfect contentment. I wore a suit with a vest, and she a white English dress with frills and lace. Gulls swooped at bits of bread tossed up into the air, and the sky was a brilliant, blue infinity. My lovely scene burst like a soap bubble when an old peasant man emerged in the narrow space separating ourselves from the crowd. His dark leathery face was almost comically adorned by a wispy white beard. His watery, perhaps diseased eyes perpetually shifted in their sockets.  "Lad," he said hoarsely, "you've gone on about these three principles, these three 'treasures' of yours for quite some time now, but ours is a small village with no school or resident scholar. So we haven't had the benefit of higher culture." He shrugged his shoulders and raised his arms. "I simply cannot understand what you're on about.  For instance, this 'nationalism'.  What does it mean?  We once had a dynasty known as the Qing, but now it's gone.  Is 'nationalism' an educated word for dynasty? Is your great army going to establish a new one?  And as for 'equality' or 'democracy', why it's plain to any fool, even a half-blind like myself, that that could never work.  Are we to understand that the country is to be ruled by peasants just like us?" The old man patted his bony chest and looked down at the ground, cackling and shaking his head in amusement.  "Even if it were possible for all of us to leave our homes and meet in one place or for some tireless fellows such as yourselves to walk the length and breadth of the land soliciting the people's opinions, we are all so ignorant!  We would sure make a shamble of things." He waved his hands in front of his face. "Now don't take this the wrong way, young gentlemen. We appreciate your efforts. We can see for ourselves that you aren't the devils that they made you out to be--""Nor was our old general the monster they claim," came another voice, and many in the crowd snickered."But," resumed the old man, "you speak in riddles."Cool as ever, the unflappable Shi perused the crowd and then directed his attention back to the old man. 'Socialism'," he said looking down from his platform, "or rather 'people's livelihood' makes sense, doesn't it?""Of course it does," answered the old man. "All of us know enough about hunger and the need for 'livelihood', thank you very much. It's this Sun Yat-sen fellow who thought up these three principles. To us he is the greatest mystery of them all.  Undoubtedly a scholar of some repute, but Brother, has he studied the rites of Confucius?"Shi smiled and stared intently at his ancient interrogator. "Granddad," he said, "Sun Yat-sen is Confucius's greatest modern-day disciple."A gap-toothed grin spread across the weathered face. He turned and lifted up his arms to the smiling peasants behind him. "A disciple of Confucius," he uttered with real strength in his voice. Swinging around once more to look up at the boyish Shi, he said, "Why didn't you tell us so from the start?" He wagged a finger. "You nearly confused us."It was only then, with this ridiculous conclusion and such a decrepit, ignorant old man agitating the ragged crowd before us that I suddenly understood what we were really all about. To make these people see and understand, to kindle their anger and hatred and hope so that they would fight not merely their oppressors but their own ignorance and become the nation for which we longed, this was the work at hand. Just then a sound was heard overhead like the distant drone of giant bees.  With shouts and cries the peasants scattered in all directions. My companions and I looked up toward the clouds and saw what appeared to be two great eagles soaring side by side.  Their wings were squared at the ends, their bodies white.  Their tails resembled those of dragon lobsters."They're airplanes," said Cui in awe. "They must be.""Airplanes?" I said. "I've never seen one before."At first the airplanes seemed to be moving slowly, sluggishly. But then they dove towards us, and they grew very large very fast."How is it possible?" I cried above the roar. "How do they fly?""Perhaps they're not all that heavy!" shouted Cui.  "Perhaps they're made of very light wood? Or bamboo and silk? Or maybe some material we don't even know about.""It's science!" declared Shi. "Quite beyond us!" "We could understand if we wanted to!" I protested.  "If we had the chance!"The airplanes pulled out of their dives, swooping over head. There came a terrific blast that threw all three of us to the ground. For several seconds I was too stunned to move. As the pain in my head became acute, I struggled to my feet."What happened?" I said.Through the dust in the air I saw Shi sitting on the ground a small distance to my left. He was holding his wrist and gaping at his hand."Did you fall on your wrist?" I asked. "Is it sprained?"As I moved closer I saw that where the boy's knuckles and fingers had been was now a mass of churned flesh.  Long needle-like splinters of white bone were jammed into the back of his hand.Cui grabbed Shi by the shoulders and pulled him up to his feet. "Run!" he screamed. "Run!"I looked up to see the airplanes hurtling towards us again. I began to run. The dirt and pebbles leapt up around me, dancing to the chatter of machine guns. I ran as fast as I could, but Cui moved ahead of me. Three dark holes appeared on his broad back, and he dove headlong into the ground. Then he was behind me. I ran past the old peasant man, his contorted body upon the ground, his face turned upwards to expose an agonized grin. I ran on without seeing the sky or the things I went past or even the ground in front of me. I ran into a dense grove of bamboo, and I kept running, twisting from side to side to avoid hitting green stalks.  When I fell, I didn't get up again, but lay for a long time on my stomach.I waited until nightfall to come out of the bamboo grove. I took as direct a path as I knew back to the monastery where my unit was bivouacked. The front gate was lit by a hanging lantern. A monk swept the stones before the entrance. We ignored each other as I walked by.Inside the monastery's large hall were six monks seated cross-legged upon the floor offering prayers to a gilded Buddha. The chamber was dimly lit by a few dozen candles.  Ribbons of incense smoke rose and disappeared into the darkness of the painted rafters above the Buddha's brow. I walked out of the hall and into the first inner courtyard, where part of the unit was quartered. Some of my comrades were cooking supper. One man was preparing his bedding.  I left this courtyard and went through a second prayer chamber to a much larger courtyard. There were many more people here, and I found Shi at our encampment.His hand was wrapped in a blood-soaked bandage.  Even by fire light, he looked pale, bloodless. His normally fierce eyes were dull. He seemed to nod at the ground. His legs were tucked beneath him in a way to suggest that they had simply folded under his weight. I touched his shoulder."Have you been treated yet?" I asked."Yes," he answered, looking up just long enough to see who I was."Are you going to be alright?" I said."Yes.""Have you seen Cui?" Shi didn't respond, so I started preparing my bedding. But then a minute or two later he said, "Look around.""I have," I told him. "Can't find him anywhere."Shi shook his head."Tell me if you need anything," I said.His head stopped moving.I lay down beside him, on Cui's blanket, and shut my eyes. I was drowsy, exhausted, dead tired, but couldn't fall asleep. My thoughts drifted back to Hat-topped Mountain, where I and Ming-xu had spent one glorious summer.  We were together again, picking mulberry leaves, taking pains to choose young, tender ones.  We brought these back to Mistress Wu for her silk worms, which were approaching their final life stage. As they nibbled on the leaves, we watched the green plant substance travel through their transparent bodies.  They would soon be weaving silk cocoons.I awoke to shouts and the pounding of feet. I looked around, but couldn't find Shi. People were crowding along the monastery's back wall, climbing over.  Many were barefoot.  I grabbed hold of a man running by. "What's going on?" I stammered."The enemy," he shouted hysterically.  "They're in the city! They're at the gates!" The man broke free of my grip and bolted for the wall.I got up and started jogging in the same direction, but then realized that I too was barefoot. I ran back to where I had been sleeping. As I bent down to pick up my shoes, I saw bright flashes in the darkness and heard claps of thunder.  Dropping my shoes, I dashed for the wall, at the base of which lay several bodies. Just as I came onto the wall, I leapt and caught hold of the top. I pulled myself up onto the crest and swung one leg over to the other side. At that moment, a familiar voice called out, "Nooo!" I looked down to find Shi clinging to the legs of a man who was hanging from the wall close beside me."Let go!" screamed the man, "or you'll pull us both  down!""Nooo!" pleaded Shi. He started to weep and pressed his face against the man's leg."Shi!" I shouted, and he lifted his head to look up at me.  Straddling the top of the wall, I worked my way over to the hanging man and grabbed hold of his wrist. "I'll help you!" I said.  "You'll both get over!""You're mad!" cried the man.I looked down at Shi and saw him smile. He opened his mouth, perhaps to speak, but before he could utter a sound, the smile turned into an tortured grimace as a bullet pinned him against the wall.  The struggling man suddenly groaned and grew limp, and I let go his wrist. Shi collapsed. The limp man fell on top of him.  I looked across the courtyard and saw soldiers aiming rifles at me.  I dropped down to the grass on the other side of the wall. There was a liquid warmth on my leg, just below the knee. I felt with my hands and then put my wet fingers to my tongue.  Blood.  There was no pain.  I ran into the night.The morning found me wedged between two walls built close together. I half squatted with my back pressed against the one wall and my knees jammed into the other. I stood up and side-stepped out from this crevice between adjacent houses.  I looked up at the sky: clouds just like the day before, cotton white and fluffy. I looked down at my calves: brown, dried blood but no wound. The blood belonged to someone else.  I found some filthy clothes in a rubbish heap and changed into these. Then I made my way through the town. When I came upon a warlord patrol, I hurried up to them and stretched out my hands."Good sirs," I said meekly, "alms for the monastery. I will pray for your reincarnation.""You're no monk," one of them hissed. "Filthy beggar," and he waved me off with a curse.I was almost out of town when I noticed a large crowd of several hundred. They were watching something in a field.  I had not seen another soldier since the patrol, so I walked up to the crowd and pushed my way through.  There in the middle of the field were thirty or forty soldiers and five members of my unit.  All five were on their knees, stripped to the waist and with their arms tied behind their backs. I recognized the young woman, a volunteer from the South.  We had on occasion flirted.Slits had been cut close to the throats of the four men such that cords threaded through these slits tethered the men by their collarbones. Their chests were clean but for a few smudges of dirt and long streaks of blood extending down from their wounds.  The young girl was tethered by a cord strung through slits cut into the sides of her breast and knotted around her tit.An officer walked up to the soldier holding the girl's cord and said something to him. When the officer stepped backwards, the soldier moved forward, jerking on his line, and the girl shuffled forward on her knees. Tears streamed down her face. Every time she stopped, the soldier yanked hard on her cord. Halfway across the field, she fell to the ground and couldn't lift herself up again, so the officer went to her. She rolled onto her back, and he drew his pistol, shooting her in the chest.  The soldiers turned their attention to one of the male prisoners, and I quietly pushed my way back out of the crowd.After two days, I wandered into territory held by the Nationalists. I was captured, eventually identified and sent back to my unit, which was now two thirds its original strength. The battle for Anhui and Shandong provinces seesawed back and forth for weeks. In the end, the revolutionary army scratched its way into Shandong to stay.We marched towards Jinan, capital of Shandong, but before we got there, the Japanese took the city. They gouged out the eyes of the mayor, cut off his nose and ears. Chiang Kai-shek and his ally the Christian General Feng decided against a confrontation with the Japanese. This second Northern Expedition veered into Henan province instead, and we took Zhengzhou.From Zhengzhou, we advanced on Beijing, for which old Chiang had revived the antiquitous name of Beiping or "northern peace".  The mighty warlord Zhang Zuo-lin withdrew without a fight into Manchuria, where he was killed by a bomb planted in his train by the Japanese.  His son became the "Young Marshal" of the North, and he set his heart on revenge. We entered "Beiping" without bloodshed.

7#$"Jb&F*W*W8888J8X8X8X8d8z889x8X9 9=*>C8=9 ==JZ======Chapter 5: Back to SchoolAfter I was discharged at the end of the war, I returned to Nanjing. I didn't bother going to General Chiang's staff headquarters to redeem his promise. Who would remember such a promise?  And I had no will to repeat the waiting game I'd played outside the general's mansion.  Instead, I sat a second time for the entrance exam of the Nationalist Party Central Political School, which had recently reopened as a regular four-year university. Naturally I passed. Which entitled me to another full fellowship.Before the commencement of classes, I was summoned by Mr. Lo, dean for academic instruction. Once more, I found myself in the richly furnished office of an all-powerful administrator, standing at attention before his polished desk."It has been brought to my attention," informed Dean Lo, "that you were once expelled from this school." The man's fine Western-style suit seemed wasted on someone so repulsive. His eyes bugged out, his flat nose was much too wide for his face and from a large wart at the corner of his mouth sprouted a couple of finger-length hairs. "Respectfully," I said, "may I ask who brought this to your attention?"He answered, "That's not the issue here.""If it wouldn't be too much," I continued, "I'd like to know. Was it Mr. Gu, the former dean of student affairs?"Clearing his throat in an attempt to regain the upper hand, Mr. Lo said, "I assume that you know old Gu just recently joined Wang Jing-wei's Wuhan faction?""Yes," I said.  "I am aware." For having openly opposed General Chiang's murderous policies, Gu had lost his position at the school."Three thousand applicants for admission," said Dean Lo with fresh confidence, "and five hundred accepted. Even if old Gu had had access to the rolls before his defection, how likely is it that your name would have jumped out at him?""Not very," I admitted."Not very, indeed. Now tell me. What would you have done, had you failed the admissions exam but someone formerly expelled had passed?""A classmate," I concluded incredulously. Perhaps even someone I had marched with in the campaign. The dean frowned. "Not everyone is as magnanimous as you."I had really understood all along and now it did dawn on me afresh that Dean Gu had really done nothing to deserve my dogged attempts at public humiliation. Moreover, he had proven his metal as a man of conviction. If captured, he would lose his head. And I had betrayed him. Small wonder someone had betrayed me."Students who have disgraced the school and party," resumed Mr. Lo in a subdued voice and with downcast eyes, "are not formally eligible for readmittance.... But in your case ...  the case of a junior officer who put his life on the line and served with distinction ... it is only fair that there should be exception.""Then," I said slowly, "I may come back?""Unfortunately, the matter is not entirely in my hands. But something can be done, and I will try."The thanks I expressed to Dean Lo was sincere. He barely acknowledged before sending me out the door.After the defeat of the warlords, the houses of Chiang, Sung, Kung and Chen had emerged as preeminent in Nationalist China. Chen Guo-fu, head of the fourth family, was Chiang Kai-shek's right-hand man and first director of our new university.  It was to his office at party central headquarters that I was summoned a few days after my interview with Dean Lo.An hour before the appointed time, I arrived at a large building with shadowy corridors. Asking directions of cadres I met in the hallway, I navigated a course to Director Chen's office suite. The door was open, so I slipped inside. The reception room seemed exceptionally sterile, even by bureaucratic standards. At a desk sat a young cadre in a revolutionary tunic that was bare of military or political insignias. He instructed me to take a seat.After only fifteen minutes, I was escorted into the inner office, which was flooded by sunlight streaming in through four tall windows. In front of these windows was a extremely large desk behind which sat a gaunt man in an almost ridiculously over-sized tunic, also unadorned. I planted myself before he whom I assumed to be the illustrious Chen Guo-fu. When the man didn't look up from his work, I resumed my reconnaissance.To my left was a long wooden table strewn with papers, books and maps. Set around this table were six comfortable-looking padded chairs. To my right, seated at a small desk pushed up against the wall was a young cadre with his back to me. He too seemed absorbed in work."You were wise to have written me before marching off to war," said Director Chen. I faced forward.  "When Dean Lo brought your case to my attention," he continued, "it all came back to me. You were to be rewarded for your military services, were you not?"I could hardly believe that after all this time someone as important as Director Chen remembered a letter from a lowly and impudent student.  An unexpected sense of gratification almost prompted me to blurt out something silly and sentimental, but I managed to say only, "Yes sir," and offer a low bow.Director Chen considered me for only a moment before saying, "You want a position.""I want a second chance at school. Which was what I'd originally asked for in my letter.""Return to school?" he said dropping his pencil and rubbing his hands together. "Return to the tedium and austerity of student life?  You're saying something you think I want to hear.""No, Sir," I protested, my arms pressed to my sides. "I say what I mean.""You--" started Director Chen, but before he could get another word out, an unseen force seemed to grip him. For several ponderously long seconds he sat frozen, his jaw slack, and what finally came out was a deep, hacking cough. Hesitantly, I moved forward, but the young cadre who had been working at the small desk rushed to his patron's aid.  He put a hand on Director Chen's shoulder and reached into the waist pocket of his superior's jacket.  Fishing out a round silver box, he pried off its lid and held the box just beneath the director's mouth.  The coughing slowly abated, and when Director Chen was quiet again, he spit a stringy wad of yellowish-green phlegm into the silver box. As he wiped his mouth with a handkerchief, the young man replaced the lid on the silver box and slipped it back into his patron's pocket.  Purpose served, the young man returned to his post."You may go back to school," said Director Chen.  "But your status will be probationary.""Thank you, Director Chen," I said with another bow. "Probationary means no talking during weekly party assemblies. Not one word for the next four years. An end  to rabble rousing.""Yes, Director Chen.""Do you really understand?""Yes.""Do you give me your word?"I raised my head high and peered into the director's sunken eyes."Yes." "Good," he concluded with a sigh. "I can see that you've learned your place."I dropped my gaze. I had learned my place. Director Chen gave me a quick nod to signal that I could go. University life was what I had expected. I studied hard, learned a great deal and forgot an alarming amount after the conclusion of each semester's final exams. My favorite subject by far was mathematics, which I would have majored in had the university offered such an option. The next best thing in our political institution was finance, so this became my primary topic.In my leisure time I practiced brushwork calligraphy and watercolor painting. The academy's martial arts instructor was a well-known master, so I took advantage of the opportunity to learn the broadsword and spear.  I dutifully attended every weekly party assembly, but kept my promise to Director Chen and maintained an unbreakable silence, which was, at times, admittedly a strain.  On occasion, I secretly attended Communist cell meetings, but despite my growing admiration for the Bolsheviks' revolutionary ardor, I was perhaps too cynical and very likely too cowardly to seriously consider joining their ranks. I remained a Nationalist.I took solace in the company of a young woman named Deng Lo-hua. We had actually been classmates before the war, but it was only at the front that we met. In the closing weeks of the campaign, she had listened to my rambling monologues and abided my long silences. I obsessed about the swings of battle and her fate if captured. Yet also, this acute, almost electric anxiety over her safety and well-being ... somehow began to mend my shattered soul.Two Skies     v before the war however,I admitted, "Not very."with whom I had marchedN on me afresh that Dean Gu had I was not surprised.I concluded,  former classmate.

I lay in bed, my mind dull and heavy. Outside, birds were singing. Every needle note pricked my heart and hurried its beat.  My face felt flushed. I mopped my moist forehead with a tee-shirt, then draped it over my eyes. I suddenly realized that my jaws were clamped. I told myself to relax, breathe deeply, evenly. There wasn't any need to get up early this morning. I wasn't going to work.After a time, the mounting numbness of my mind seeped into my limbs.  A coolness swept across my brow, and I luxuriated in a familiar but long gone sense of security. It was Mother.  Her fingers were combing through my hair again.  Looking up, I saw her gentle, smiling face."You're a brave little boy," she said in a voice as yielding as water. "To stay home completely by yourself while I walk your sister to school. What do you think about lying here all alone? You aren't afraid, are you?""I think about cartoons," I answered, which was my way of tipping her how I avoided thinking about ghosts and demons."So that's your secret, Little Precious. How many three year old little boys could come up with such a strategy? This afternoon when I go out again to fetch your sister, I'm going to buy you a little bag of candy."The pillow was soft and warm beneath my head, but I sat up anyways. There was a matter of pressing importance to which I needed to attend. "Father says that when I grow up I have to have a little boy too, or else the family will come to an end."Mother sighed deeply. A frown creased her forehead. Her expression clouded over like an afternoon sky pondering rain."Is it true?""Yes, Little Precious. And no." Mother screwed up her face and shut her eyes. She kept them shut for what seemed a long time. But then when she opened them again, her resurrected smile seemed all the brighter. "If you don't have a little boy someday, our family name won't be passed down through your children." She chuckled. "You see, if you have a little girl, she'll take the family name of her husband.""Little girl?" Mother pouted. "Don't you like little girls?"I nodded "yes".She brushed my hair to one side and put her hands on my shoulders. She eased me back down to my pillow. "You may have as many or as few children as you like. Even none at all. Provided, of course, your wife agrees."I already understood that a wife was part of the bargain, but the way she put it made the prospect sound distressingly near at hand. As long as my wife agrees. I might have stopped up my ears right then and there and gone into a blind panic, but somehow I managed to keep my wits."Although you've never met them," said Mother, "you do have boy cousins in China, so it isn't entirely on your shoulders. Besides, a family name isn't really all that important.""What if I don't want a wife?""Well ... that's your decision too."My mother's words were my currency of truth.  Hence, her reassurance had a liberating effect. The burden was suddenly lifted. Indeed, I felt quite light. As a feather. "What was your family name?" I already knew."My family name," said Mother proudly, "is 'Li'.""And Grandfather was a soldier?""'Marshal Li'." Like an artist sculpting in soft clay, Mother traced my eyebrows with her forefingers. "A great commander, who would have been immensely proud of his extraordinary little grandson, no matter what the family name." She traced my nose and then my mouth; she gently rubbed with her thumbs my two round cheeks. "You see, a name is only a word--a series of brush strokes, a sound. And there are so many, many names in the world.  The only thing that rescues any poor name from drowning in the vast sea of names is the meaning its owner imparts."I looked into my mother's deep brown eyes. In my mind I overcame my child's shyness and reached out to touch her long black hair, which fell about her shoulders. "If when you grow up you work hard and always do your best, if you never surrender or give up in what you start and if, the Sky forbid, you stand steadfast even in the face of war and death, then your name will live on after you are gone.  Then you will live on in the memory of those who follow.  Your grandson may have a different name, a foreign name, he may not have known you a day in his life, but he will still remember you just as you remember your grandfather now."My wandering eyes were drawn to the window. The sun was shining; the leafy boughs of a little apple tree were swaying in a breeze. There seemed to be life among those shimmering leaves. Bird perhaps or squirrels. Maybe even mischevious fox fairies. "Don't worry, Little Precious." She lay a hand upon my tiny heaving chest. "Just do your best, and your mother will be well pleased. You are far too bright and strong for your best not to be good enough. Good enough by a good, generous measure."Mother had misunderstood. My heavy sigh was not for worry but contentment. I was absolutely satisfied with the world and my lot in it."Love and sacrifice, Little Precious. Love and sacrifice. A person's first duty. A person's last."A thunderous clap rended my delicate sleep. Through the thick mental fog echoed a rapid series of loud thumps. Soon thereafter came the roar of a car engine. I looked momentarily at the rusty folding card table that served as my desk. I looked up at my single window, squat and flush with the ground outside. Through its glass pane, washed clear as crystal by evening rain, the front lawn grass appeared dark from moisture. I heard the car pull away; a housemate was just leaving for work or school. There was something moist beneath my chin. I felt my pillow and found it wet with saliva.Although the light through the window was still wane, I guessed that I had slept longer than reckoned, and the morning was already beginning to age. The bird songs of my first awakening had stopped; the rain had started again.I listened intently; no sound could be heard from the other side of the flimsy partition that divided one small room into two tiny cells. My unseen roommate had already gone for the day. I threw off my blankets and surrendered myself to the air's cold embrace. I rose to my feet, but a rush of dizziness forced me back down to my knees. My head throbbed.  A chemical scent drew my eyes to the automobile carburetor sitting in an aluminum baking tray in the corner.  I picked my towel up off the worn carpet and trudged to the basement bathroom, the linoleum floor of which was still wet from the morning's traffic. Shuffling forward, I waded into the domestic swamp.Anka was in the living room at her easel. A few steps behind her lay a black and white cat sprawled out on the carpet. Not far from the animal was an empty wine bottle, and next to this a plate smeared with the saucy remnants of a meal.  I slipped past the living room portal and into the kitchen."There's some salad in the refrigerator, David," called Anka from her easel. "If you want some, plenty of dark olives. I know how you like the salty taste. Like a cat.""Thanks," I said."I have sharp ears and eyes to keep watch over you," she cried. "Sokolowska the 'hawk'!""Don't you just wish she'd confine those foul-smelling oil paints of hers to the far side of the basement," came Michael's voice.  I turned around to find the big man seated at the kitchen table nursing a walnut-sized cappuccino cup. "Ever since the two of you started sketching together in the evenings she's suffered from the terrible delusion that the living room is actually a communal studio or something. Well, I say, 'Back. Back.  Back to the dark lagoon at the end of the hall.' Don't worry, the door seals odor-tight, so I'm not condemning you people down there to anything worse than death." His dark silk suit and tie were sleekly contemporary. A tiny diamond stud sparkled from his right earlobe."Morning Michael," I said."Good morning," returned my housemate with a gracious smile and nod.As I advanced towards the refrigerator I called out, "Thanks again Anka, but I think I'll settle for some toast.""Okay," answered Anka, "suit yourself.""Feel free to take whatever you want," added Michael with a wink. "I do. It's one of those share houses where we really share and share alike."I smiled and said, "I know.""Well," said Michael, "just so you do."When my toast was done, I poured a glass of orange juice and brought my food out into the living room cum dining room, where a large table was pushed up against the wall abutting the kitchen.  I was surprised to find another housemate, Erin, already at the table eating her breakfast and reading the morning paper.  When I sat down, she looked up briefly and smiled.  Somewhat embarrassed, I said, "The only one missing now is Jon.""And Marsha," corrected Michael from the kitchen."They're both early risers," said Anka from her easel."It would appear," concluded Erin.  Then she returned her attention to the paper.  The thrift-shop hunting jacket I wore over my natty night robe contrasted comically with her cabled sweater of fine black wool. An English girl. I looked to Anka, whose gelled hair was slicked back over her head. She wore her favorite smock, an expansive cotton shirt with a huge neck opening. The way it fell over her body completely exposed her breasts, which were large and shapely. "What are you working on today?" I asked.Anka looked up from her palette without making the slightest effort to cover herself. "Self portrait," she announced and turned the easel for my benefit. It was a painting in the ornate, colorful and rigid style of Russian orthodox icons. The central figure of the saint, however, was replaced by Anka in fetal position. She was enveloped by an amorphous barrier, obviously meant to represent the womb.  A slender, wedge-shaped scalpel blade penetrated the membrane wall and cut into Anka's white halo. I looked from the portrait to the artist.  The same crooked smile and wild, predatory eyes.  Only, the living woman's eyes were bloodshot, and I thought I perceived a slight tremor in her fingers.  Every time I had gotten up during the night I had heard her moving about upstairs.  Her sole companions had probably been the cat and cocaine. "What do you think?" asked Anka.I shook my head and uttered the first thing that came to mind: "Dagger.""What?" said Anka."The image is sharp and piercing," I said, " like a knife."Her smile grew even bigger, and she gave me a thumbs up. "Thank you!" she said excitedly. "It's for you!  My protector saint!  Patron saint David!" As she knelt down I almost expected her to cross herself, but instead she stroked the cat, which had glided silently to her feet.  "Hear that, Chich-kou.  It's dagger. Just like you.""Chich-kou means 'pussy' in Polish," informed Michael, who was now standing by the foyer entrance with his enormous back against the frame and his cup of cappuccino pinched between thick fingers."Maybe Michael deserves another bite," said Anka to her cat. "And you another lick of his thick, rich blood." She looked at me.  "Chich-kou protects me from my friends. She's very jealous.""A most exclusive pussy," confirmed Michael nonchalantly."Um," said Erin somewhat self-consciously. "Are you going to work today?"At first I thought she was addressing Michael, but when Michael didn't respond, I turned to her and said, "Who? Me?""Yes," answered Erin."No," I said, scraping some charcoal off my toast with a butter knife. "Is it a rest day?" she pursued. I knew she was only trying to divert the conversation, so I was under no real obligation to divulge significant information.  Still, I said, "Got fired," trying not to notice her beauty."Oh!" she responded even more off-balance than before. "I'm so sorry!  Truly I am!""The ax, huh?" said Michael looking quickly at his watch. Anka put her brush down and came over to the table. "Yeah?" she said. "That's terrible, David. What happened? Tell us about it."Shut up, I exhorted myself. Keep your mouth shut. "Yesterday afternoon," I couldn't seem to help myself from saying, "the guy I was working for asked me to cut a circular hole in a wall of this bathroom we were finishing." I examined the corners of my burnt toast. "I guess it wasn't round enough for him.""I thought there was something about you this morning," said Michael with a note of triumph in his voice. He began to move his head slightly from side to side like a blind musician lost in song. "I could sense them, the spirits, that is. Three or four hovering above your head.  They're drawn to confusion, you know.""You can see them?" I said.He bellowed, "Not through these dark glasses!" and laughed heartily at his own joke.Erin stared at Michael with a taut expression, which she probably thought more than adequately expressed disapproval."Gosh," said Anka smiling crookedly. "Was it an important job?"I blurted, "How round does a hole that's going to be hidden behind some aluminum bathroom fixture have to be anyways?"Michael burst into more peels of laughter. "Got to look out for those round holes." Her face reddening, Erin leaned towards me and whispered  "I'm sorry for being so nosy."I dropped my gaze. "You weren't being nosy." "David," said Anka laying a hand on my arm and squeezing. "It's best to be honest with friends, right? Say what we feel? So I tell you now, baby, if you need help, I help.""You've already helped, simply by making room for me here."She smiled. "That was helping Jon. He needed a break with rent, so dividing his room was perfect solution. No, David.  I still owe you for helping me. Money I have only a little, but if I have a dollar, you have a dollar.""Thank you, Anka." I felt genuinely moved by her concern but also a little embarrassed by the extent of this generosity.  "I ...  I ...""Maybe he could move into your room," said Michael in Anka's direction, "and get a real break in rent.""Any time," said Anka at Michael with the fierceness of a challenge.Suddenly the big man became quiet and, yanking off his dark glasses, pulled a palm-size notebook scheduler out of a pocket and started fumbling with it  "I've got to get going," he said, raising his head, and I saw the forlorn look in his tired eyes.  He quickly turned to me and offered, "I'd give you an office job in my department, but right now we simply aren't hiring.""That's alright," I said feeling mildly appreciative but much more so contemptuous. "I'll find something. It's only a matter of time."Putting on his shades again, he said to Anka, "I'll pick you up at three?" "Okay." "Must be nice being a big systems analyst." I tried to smile a smile of real appreciation. "You can go to work late and leave any time you want." I crunched my toast."He isn't going to work," said Anka."Oh yeah?" I said. "Day off?""I'm going to the hospital." "Hospital?" said Erin. "Is anything the matter with you?" "Martin, his boyfriend," said Anka, "he tried to kill himself last night." For a long moment Erin and I were motionless.  Anka's tilted smile widened. "Obviously it was over me," she added, answering the question that neither of us dared voice.  "Pills." She bent her head backwards and popped a handful of invisible sedatives.  "He's crazy, fucking crazy. I mean, it's not like I'm Michael's piece of ass or anything.  Come on. It's impossible. He's just my source, and every now and then he 'escorts' me to party. We're girlfriends." She chuckled.  "Yeah. Just like Chich-kou and me. Hey, maybe somebody should fix Michael because he doesn't need it anyways, and then maybe his poor little boy girlfriend won't need pills to fall asleep." Anka opened her eyes very big and laughed.  A few seconds later, we were listening to her machine-gun laughter moving rapidly down the basement corridor, and Michael was gone too.I sat there quite still, my gaze fixed on the unappetizing toast on my plate.  After a time I worked up the courage to lift my head and glance across the table at Erin.  She was looking back at me, a deep sadness in her eyes. What appeared to be the streak of a tear marked the side of her cheek. I quickly dropped my gaze again.Two Skies     vnB#&!!!!!!$$44"9W9Y9~999:H:L::::CaCpCqCrCuCvC{C|JWJJJJJJJJK+KgKpKqKKKKKKL:L;L<LDLELKLMLNLOLPLRLXLYLjLLLLLLLMM!M{M|M}MMMMMMM@P@Y~34ABJY2C609[-6""#"##$O$m$&H&{&'((*,,),s,,..//0000112%2a24V45V5s56@667O77889:-::<T<=)=3=>> >?>{BC`CaCrCsCtCuCvC|JJJJJJKL<LELPLLN<NfNNOOO-OR/RQRhRRRS)S+S5S[SqSzS,Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@BErin's features rounded.

Look at the trog. He had simply cast out his father, washed his hands of the man, none of this wavering back and forth, I was sick of vacilating between prosecution and acquitalChapter 7: Journeys of the MindI spent the rest of the morning in my room.  My construction boss had come up to me the day before with a twenty dollar bill in his hands--severance pay--and a steeled expression on his face. I'd noticed how an initial enthusiasm had gradually waned with each task not done to standard. I could imagine him telling the other workers how this boy simply hadn't panned out.I had once led back country crews across the mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina. I had led a timbering crew in Utah. Who was this old man with his circular cuts in bathroom linoleum? What did he know about real work? What did he know about anything? ...  But then again, what did I know? A Chinese-American loser sitting in his basement half-room. My thoughts circled the present circumstances like condors over dying cattle.But then again again... why? Such silliness. What, afterall, did my problems amount to? I had food in my stomach. I had a dry place to sleep. Nobody was trying to kill me. Nobody was even getting on my case. Was my world really so small and narrow that I could not escape comparative trivialities?Approaching two o'clock, I rode my bike to Stanford University to check the campus bulletin boards for job ads.  Then I rode into town to check back on some offices where I'd left resumes.  After that, I patrolled the streets, telling myself that I should have stood the pain of last week's toothache. Treatment had cost over a hundred dollars, and a mouthful of problems had been exposed.  The next visit would cost over four hundred and fifty, more than three weeks' wages. "Forget the toothache," I sang. "Concentrate on mighty Honda." If Michael's lover actually did die I would not have cared more. Of course, I'd never even seen Martin. This broken down old car, on the other hand, had carried my mother to hospital, had sheltered me during the long trip West and now still afforded me a sliver of a chance in the mobile warfare of a modern job search. Eventually, I'd have to abandon her to the street vultures and hitchhike back to LA, but not just yet. "Forget the car," I rejoined. Forget this and forget that. "Forget it," I commanded myself. Look at the big picture. Don't sweat the nitty gritty. "Just forget it."At eight-thirty, I was executing figure eight's in front of a local cinema and catching glimpses of the movie posters with each pass by the front facade. The temptation to indulge myself was strong, but I knew better than to squander five dollars and fifty cents.  Five fifty could pay for two decent meals at MacDonalds, four or five meals at home, a twelve pack of cheap beer or a phone call back to Pennsylvania. I couldn't help myself smiling. I couldn't stop myself laughing. There really seemed no escape from this deplorable, pathetic self pity. "What's the problem?" I shouted. "What ... is ... the ... problem?"  The movie theater ticket clerk glanced my way, trying perhaps not to look apprehensive, just in case this happened to be some sort of wierdo in front of her booth. In my own eyes, I had become the umistakeable prince of fools.When I got back home, the living room was abandoned, Anka's easel no where to be seen. So I went back down into my hole.  There I pulled out my desert boots from under a pile of dirty laundry and fetched from my backpack my long knife.The black, lusterless blade was razor sharp and edged on both sides of its curved tip. I held up one of the boots, its leather scraped and weathered. I poised the knife. These shoes had taken me across a continent, but now were useless. Without hesitation, I cut into the hide. It didn't pay to be overly sentimental with inanimate objects such as shoes and cars. The black blade quickly reduced both boots to a neat pile of polygonal scraps, which might come in handy in the future. I took one of the nylon boot laces, black and worn but still strong, and looped it through my mother's golden wedding band. I tied the two ends of the lace in a dead knot, then raised the closed loop over my head, slipping it down around my neck, slipping it beneath my shirt so that the metal lay cool against the skin.As I fingered the golden ring through the fabric of my shirt I pictured Father as he walked down the street, his feet shuffling forward inches at a time with nobody even to notice how slow his movements or how hunched his back.  He stopped periodically in this pointless journey to linger before a shop window. I fought hard to hold back the tears. I started shaking. But what was his ghost's existence in comparison to all that she had had to endure in life? She would be avenged. She must be!  I could do my bit by staying away. If I found a good job or rather when I did, I would get a nice apartment, a new car. That was already settled. And why not? Why in the world not?When I shut the lights and lay down in bed, my thoughts wandered mercilessly. In the pitch darkness I seemed to roam for mile after pointless, agonizing, self-incriminating mile. Hours later, just as the night sky outside my tiny window started growing light, I drifted into a half-sleep and began to knit a half-dream. Once more, my soul leapt three thousand miles. Once more I found myself suspended in mid air so to speak, a mere phantom, with nothing to do but to wait. With nothing to do but to watch. Finally, the ancient man opened his eyes a crack. Another morning. I could see not only his face, the exterior, the slack skin and lifeless features, but into his mind. She had not come to him in his dreams.  As far as he could tell, he had not dreamt.  It was as though he were already dead. He longed to see her. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if she came back to haunt him, torment him, level the finger of blame at him. An unknown amount of time passed before he pushed away the covers and, with great effort, sat himself up on the edge of his mattress. He was so short that his feet touched but lightly upon the carpet. His night robe lay at the foot of his bed, and the chilly air compelled him to reach for it.  After getting one arm through a sleeve, he paused briefly to rub his eyes and mutter, "Why am I still here?" Then he yawned and finished the battle with his robe.He struggled to his feet and took half a dozen steps to the windows.  He drew back the thick, velvet curtains, and sunlight, strong through the leafless trees, struck him hard in the face.  He shielded his eyes with his hands. "Your purpose," he seemed to hear a voice say through the dazzling haze, "is your children." This had been his wife's mission and cause. It was now his through appointment by her. It had always been his as well, but since her departure, it had fallen squarely on his shoulders alone, frail and weak as they were. He had become an angel's representative on earth--her eyes, ears and hands. He was still alive because the children needed him. They might have been far, far away and he as helpless as a mouse, but still they depended on him.  He had to keep going. His heart must not stop beating.After breakfast, he put on a coat for the long journey downtown to the senior center.  Only six short blocks in distance, but in time, nearly an hour.  As he walked, the clock and calendar seemed to race backwards in his mind.He stopped at a busy intersection and leaned on his cane. He stood before the curb and, when the street signal flashed "walk", moved not an inch, watching, instead, two young boys speed across the road on skateboards.  He had already been an old man when his son was born, and he now smiled at the memory of a day long gone by.  That August afternoon had been sunny and unusually dry for up-state New York. Guang-yu or "David" was four years old and playing in front of the house, a toy samurai sword clinched in his tiny hand.  As the little boy raised his sword towards the sky, the man, watching from behind a screen door, whispered, "A Japanese sword." He shook his head at the irony: his son swinging an enemy blade, rubber tipped or not. Still, how the child prized this trifling possession given him by his mother. The man smiled."Come across!" came a shout from across the street. It was an American boy in jeans and a stripped tee-shirt. Other American boys flanked him to either side, and in his hand he held a broad, straight, double-edged sword of gray plastic. "Come across if you dare!" The challenger waved his weapon in the air, and the Chinese boy lowered his. The American boys responded with hoots.  They howled with laughter. "Look at that guy!" one of them cried. "He ain't about to come over!  He ain't about to set even one foot off that curb!" Jeering, they jabbed their fingers at the motionless foe.  When the situation had been wrung dry of its last humiliating drop, they paraded on, still laughing among themselves. Only after they'd disappeared around the corner did the Chinese boy retreat to the porch stairs and sit down on the bottom step.He scraped the rubber tip of his curved metal blade against the pavement and then jabbed at a pebble in a sidewalk crevice.  When the pebble jumped, he set the sword down beside himself and, after a moment more, raised his legs, wrapped his arms around them and lay his chin upon his knees.The father opened the screen door and stepped out onto the porch. The son twisted around to look up, his young eyes searching. "They are the enemy!" shouted the man. "We have fallen into the sea, and unless you fight, you will drown!""They are the enemy," hoarsely repeated the old man, and he stepped off the curb, probing ahead with his cane. He walked slowly past the row of stopped cars.  The summer's day and his little boy were gone. The cold penetrated through his thick, hooded coat, a gift from his son years ago that no longer kept him warm.  "They are the waves," he moaned. "I should have taught you better. I should have taught you better!" He shook his head. "I wanted to show you how, but you never paid attention, never even tried to understand!  To you, everyone is a 'friend'! That's how they are able to hurt you!  That's why you can only lose!"When he reached the opposite side of the street, he lifted a foot onto the curb, steadied himself with his cane and, with Herculean effort, hoisted himself up onto the sidewalk.  An audio beacon for the blind chirped mockingly from the fat metal stem of the traffic light, and the old man swung at it with his cane. The blow missed the beacon but still hit the metal stem, creating a dull, hollow clang and sending a painful vibration through the old man's arm and shoulder. "Why didn't I take you and your sister back to our own country," he lamented, "when we still had a chance!  How could I let these roots dig so deep? I should have cut them while I still had the strength!" He shuffled on, rapping his forehead with a fist, again and again. His cap began to slide off his head, and his hands moved too slowly to catch it before it fell. He knelt down to pick it up, but then fell backwards onto the icy pavement.  He sat there like a befuddled panda, not attempting to get up again.  With deep regrets and even deeper shame, he covered his eyes with his gloved hands.  Oh, how he wished he could pull his fingers away and find himself back in China!  How he wished to hear the sounds of a Chinese city and smell the smells of a Chinese street! He wanted to look into faces whose expressions he could read; he begged to be with souls whose passions he could sense! "You must stay with me!" he cried in desperation, tears welling in his eyes.  "I know that there are only alien souls here, but someday when I die, our ashes will be mixed together and taken back home.  David has promised."What rolled behind the round eyes of these Americans? What did they want from him? What did they want from his children? His children who were raised as hostages in this land of the ghosts had ghost lives of their own. He could never go home again and the thought of it was almost beyond bearing. He longed to lose consciousness, to float in lifeless oblivion. To be over, to simply be over. "Talking to yourself, Doc?" came a cheerful voice as large bare knuckles wrapped around his arm. The old man uncovered his face and looked up to find a massive troll of a man with beetle brows.  "I've been looking for you," said the giant."Me?" replied the old man, and the giant gently helped raise him to his feet.Two Skies     vtowards me r sitting in his basement half-cell  the fretting?When I got them.Including LA.

How do you force yourself not to think, keep your mind from running, whirling? My solution was to take on two full-time jobs. Simple, unskilled labor jobs. Although I could have used a challenge, top priority was to avoid getting sacked again. My jobs were so easy that messing up would have been difficult, even for me. Unfortunately, the solitude and tedium of mowing vast lawns in peopleless suburbia, of sweeping and mopping dim corridors in empty office buildings late at nights drove me still deeper into my thoughts. I tried to sleep between shifts, but I started to lose even this tenuous escape. Wakeful hours imposed themselves as a seemingly endless third shift. Father was guilty yet at the same time not guilty. He hadn't intended for his actions and inactions to harm Mother, but if this were the only factor, then punishment would have been richly deserved. Negligence is not tantamount to innocence. But as with so many convicts, here was one who had been punished before he had committed his crimes. Punishment had commenced from the first days of life and continued almost unbroken through the years of his prime. Marriage should have signaled an end of sentence, but the man had lost his ability to distinguish between captivity and freedom.He was like a man kept in darkness for years only to emerge from his cell to be blinded by the light of day, a painful glare, white "darkness". He moved about with his eyes shut tight, bumping against obstacles, knocking things over, hurting those who got into his way, including and especially his family, his wife. He had slowly knocked the life out of her without volition. Despite it all, she had loved him, and her spirit still floated over him as he slept.My mission had reversed. Sentence suspended. Fresh orders had come down from the tribunal of my conscience. I was now working on his behalf. To gain for Father a measure of release, to help him escape. I would bring him out West. He would join me in an apartment on a tree-lined street. There would be a senior citizen center within walking distance. We might not talk a lot at first; I more than suspected that he retained the uncanny ability to incite me to raptures of irritation. But at the very least, his home would have in it another living soul. I would provide a cat-like presence. Had he possessed the sensitivity to feel his wife's presence he could have had so much more. Was it possible that she intentionally obscured herself? Was she angry too? But, no. She would never hide herself from him. He simply couldn't see.I had to have money. This was now all I could see. My only certainty. I had to earn enough to take care of him or, since he had his pension, to host him in decent fashion. Hence, all the more ironic when utter exhaustion drove me into the ground and quickly threatened that critical minimum-wage income.Possibly it began in the lungs, since my first symptom was a tickling sensation deep down in my chest whenever I ran short of breath. Or it could have started in the eyes, which became so fatigued that it was difficult to focus on objects and to keep them open at all. I lost my appetite and developed a runny nose. An itchy rash appeared on my right elbow, which turned into an open sore since I clawed at it incessantly. Soon, little red blisters spread to cover the whole of the arm, the other arm, the back of my shoulders, my legs and waist and buttocks. Without a thermometer it wasn't possible to monitor the rise in body temperature, but by the third day my ravaged skin was flushed and I was alternately gripped by deep chills and burning fevers. In my unventilated room without so much as a small fan, I swam in stall, warm air and lay on sweat-soaked, blood-speckled sheets from dawn to dusk to dawn. For a day and a half I went without food, not because I didn't have the strength to get up and go to the kitchen but because I wasn't particularly hungry, because I'd finished off my last can of soup and couldn't be bothered to go out for more. Deferring to a sickly lethargy that seemed more easily accommodated by inaction than food, I drifted in and out of dreams and half-dreams.  It was I who now became the guilty one, incontrovertibly so, of abandonment. An aged parent, my child really. But by fulfilling my parental duty, justice would be subverted; the scales could never be balanced so long as he escaped punishment and neglected, consciously or not, atonement. Perhaps it was a good thing, this illness. It would drain my funds and cause the loss of my jobs thereby precluding the possibility of duty. At the same time, I had tried. I could not accuse myself of less. By the end of the second day of pitched fever there was no longer any need for food so far as I could tell.  The pangs in my stomach had subsided, and the canteen beside my bed still had a little water. Sterile as my surroundings and bleak as my circumstances were, I felt exhilarated in a stuporous, diseased way. I had become impervious to hunger. Invulnerable!... But of course, the tortorous itch all over my body and countless streaks of smeared blood indicated otherwise.By the third day, hundreds perhaps thousands of little sores were oozing pus. Moreover, my canteen was dry. I put up a terrific struggle to refill it in the basement bathroom. Thirst prevailed over delusion, and I was forced to confront my lowly mortal status. I was nothing more than a very sick, very confused young man, without prospect or promise, unshaven, dirty, foul and hideous. There seemed absolutely nothing in life to look forward to. If only some sitcom or sports event stirred an inkling of desire to peek at the tube! Indeed, I had lost even the minutest urge to channel surf. What in this modern America could more clearly signify the bottom?By the fourth day I could once again appreciate the patches of sunlight on the floor. I imagined reaching out a hand to lay flat my palm and fingers against that warm brightness, no strength left to do it in reality. My room seemed so quiet and lovely; I luxuriated in semi-conscious contentment, without any longer a care in the world.From the depths of a disease that was as much an affliction of the soul as of the body, I found myself suspended above him once more, watching from the high perspective of a fluorescent lamp hanging close beneath a concrete ceiling. The old man finished washing his hands at a deep stainless steel sink and slowly wiped them dry with a clay-smudged towel. As he worked the towel around his fingers, he looked out over the large studio. Most of the potter's wheels were unoccupied, their round aluminum plates clean but still streaked from sponging with muddy water. Two students in mud-splattered sweatshirts and sweatpants sat hunched over spinning clay forms, moist and glistening in wobbly states of metamorphosis.The huge troll-like man appeared from around a white partition. "That electric kiln is working just fine now," he said. "I don't know how you did it, but you did it."The old man chuckled, putting the towel back on its rack and pressing his damp hands against the sides of his stomach and his long denim shop apron. "You don't really need me," he said. "We both know that."For a moment, the giant's round eyes bulged, and his beetle brows curled into tiny half moons, as though in confusion or exasperation. But suddenly his expression shifted to one of gratitude. "Dr. Zhou," he said, "if you didn't help us with the equipment, I'd have to hire somebody out of my budget. And then it would still take a month or longer."The old man laughed again and shook his head.The giant countered with several emphatic nods. "Yes it would," he said. "And they wouldn't do half as good a job either." He continued nodding. "Besides, with you I get the bonus of a first-rate tutor for the kids and a first-rate artist for the studio. You're indispensable.""I think you'd better go home," said the old man with a smile. "I think Mrs. Sturluson is waiting for you.""I'll bet she is too," said Mr. Sturluson.When his friend had gone, the old man retreated to the corner of the studio reserved for his use. He put away his tools and work clothes. He did a quick inventory of his unfinished pieces set out on a shelf above his wooden work bench, coated with clay dust.  Then when everything was to satisfaction, he put on his coat. But instead of walking towards the kilns room, through which he usually exited the building, he sat down on his stool and pulled an envelope out of his coat pocket. The top had been cleanly cut open. From the envelope he removed a letter, which he carefully unfolded and read.Dear Father,It hasn't been easy, has it? But I finally got a decent job, one with good pay, good benefits, challenging work and, most importantly, opportunity. For me, there may yet be a future. It's in the publishing field, just as I'd promised, and it's a big company so my final placement could be almost anywhere.  But I'm to start as an apprentice of sorts in a modest little subdivision here in the Palo Alto area.That's okay, isn't it? I mean, we can start in the baggage train without the rank and prestige of the vanguard.  We're proud enough to know our true competence and worth and where they're bound to carry us. We have the patience to wait. Anyways, I'm just writing this quick note now to inform you. We'll talk on the phone soon.One last thing, that studio out in Berkeley is interested in your help as an instructor. They were impressed by your slides. It may take a few months to get everything approved and squared away, but maybe before too long you'll have a place out here.Jennifer sends her best.DaveThe old man set an elbow on his work bench and pulled on his beard.  A day and a half had already passed since he had first received word, but he had yet to try to reach his son by phone. Perhaps he was waiting to see if the sentences on the page would change.  During the campaigns against the warlords there had been no breakthrough victories, at least not at the time. Only in hindsight perhaps.  But this  seemed different. The tide had turned. Quite decidedly.The old man felt safe and secure, the first time in as long a time as he could remember. It was as though the enemy were in full flight. In fact, it was even better!  It was as though, the end of the whole, interminable war was within sight. Total victory! His son had charged into battle and would soon prove triumphant! Yes, this was better than safe, far better. "It's just a job," he said to himself, a grin stretching across his face. "What's so special about a job?"For some reason, the currents of euphoria carried his thoughts back to a winter's day many years ago. He had been out shoveling the sidewalk when his son returned from a snowball fight. He could tell because of the round powdery marks covering the front of the boy's black felt coat. As the boy tried to step past him, he grabbed his son's thick lapel to wheel him around.  There were no hits on the back. "Facing the enemy may be brave," he said, clapping the coat to knock off snow, "but when they're bigger, stronger, more skilled or more numerous, then it's also stupid." The old man knelt down upon the cold sidewalk to peer into his son's dark eyes.  "Always do the unexpected. Catch the enemy off his guard. If it means climbing over a wall or a mountain, then climb. If it means covering a great distance in a short time, then run. If it means staying quiet and still in one place for a hours, then turn to stone." He gripped his son's arms and gently shook him. "Surprise gives victory to the hundred over the thousand, to the thousand over the hundred thousand.  It gives victory to the exhausted and hungry, far from home and safety." The boy nodded. "Most of all," continued the father. "Surprise yourself. Do the unexpected and it will break old, stupid habits; it will break fear. You are the enemy, the greatest enemy. Who else would make you stand like a wooden target to be pelted with snowballs?  Who else would keep you from running or hiding or using your wits?  Break yourself. Break yourself! Understand? You understand?!" He shook the boy hard, and again, the boy nodded, his eyes large and unblinking as though staring at a tiger. "The enemy is all around," said the father. "He looks at us through round eyes and waits to catch us off guard. We are just this small family thousands of miles from China. She lies across a big continent and a vast ocean.  No help coming. So how can we win this war? How can we possibly win?... Tell me.  Tell me!... Tell me!" He shook his son again and again. "I want an answer. I want a word . Just one word!" "Sur ... sur ... surprise?" finally pleaded the boy, tears running down the sides of his cheeks.  The old man relaxed his grip. The boy did not dare to pull himself free. The old man let go. "Just remember," he said quietly. "Conquer yourself, then defeat the enemy.  This depends on you. We depend on you.  This family. For us, you must win the war."As he folded his letter, the old man remembered where he was--in an empty art studio in the middle of disputed territory.  Something could yet happen.  The enemy could wheel around.  Perhaps there were guns they hadn't reckoned on!His son was in the dark about this company. Had he researched its financial condition? Could it possibly be on the verge of collapse? And what about the character of its officers?  What were their intentions towards him? His son had admitted it himself that they were starting him out in a minor position of a small subsidiary. A trial period meant probation. They were testing him. Waiting. One trip-up, one mistake, and it would be over!  They would take away the job!  Rob him of yet another future!The enemy had crashed through the city's defenses, and the wolves were already prowling this his sanctuary. He stuffed the letter and envelope into his coat pocket and hurried through the firing room, dark and dusty, with giant kilns of wrought iron and brick. A hint of smoke lingered in the air. The blast of heat, even in the dead of winter, was terrific. This was indeed the oven, roasting him alive. He pushed through the door and fled out into the studio courtyard. He fled for home although it could offer no refuge. Soon the devils would enter his room to flay him with excruciating deliberateness and eat chunks of his flesh. They would cut off his ears to chew with delight, but he would still hear the accusations. They would pluck out his eyes to squeeze between their teeth like crispy, succulent pickles, but he would still see their jeering faces. He prayed for a quick death. "Forgive me," he whispered to his wife, "the wrong I have done you and our children." But forgiveness was not possible. He was guilty, he was damned.

7#$YS#b\b\+JYYYe)xu *!9 Z2Chapter 9: Florence Nightingale"In racquet ball," I informed Anka, "you serve from behind the white line." The cool feminine figures, maybe real, maybe imaginary, circulated around the tiny cell, and suddenly I realized that I had yet to open my mouth. The racquet ball conversation had all been in my head!"We thought you were perhaps away on a trip," said Erin."I'm okay," I told her, this time biting my lip to make sure I had really spoken. "Go back to your work.""Why didn't you call me!" scolded Anka. "Look how bad you let yourself become! Just look!"She waited long for reply, but of course, I couldn't really see the problem.Over the course of the next day or so, the two women took turns tending to my needs. Erin took care of meals, mainly broths and fruit juices, and Anka provided jokes and gossip. Curiously, the food didn't agree with my system, and I slowly developed a mild but persistent stomach ache. Late the second night of convalescence, I was beset by a sharp, sharp pain, as if a knife had been plunged into my guts and stirred around like a ladle in a pot of stew. I remember jesting to myself, "Now I know what childbirth is all about."  Doubled over, unable to spread my legs, I tip-toed to the bathroom. I made it to the toilet alright, but a frantic effort to undo my belt buckle wasn't quite quick enough, and I soiled my pants. For the next hour I sat on the toilet as each excruciating wave receded to be followed by a poisonous driblet. When finally the pain had done with me, I washed myself and stole back into my room with a towel wrapped around my waist and the bundle of filthy cloths in hand, tense as a burglar fretting he might be caught about his business. Unable to muster the strength or gumption to take care of the damning evidence just then, I stashed it beneath a mountain of laundry in the corner of my room.The next morning I awoke to find Erin kneeling on the floor next to my narrow futon with a large ceramic bowl beside her. She was wringing out a hand towel into the water in the bowl, and when I looked at my arm, which felt somewhat cool, I saw that the sleeve of my shirt had been rolled up to the elbow and the skin was moist. I might not have been more shocked had I found no arm at all below the joint."What are you doing?" I said."Salt water," she replied. "To dry out your sores a bit." Behind her was a wicker rocking chair, and on the chair lay a clipboard with papers attached. "I was working on something when I suddenly thought of it." Her face reddened. "I don't know why I hadn't thought of it earlier."I unrolled my shirt sleeve and looked beyond my unexpected nurse to find the room unaccountably tidy. Glancing at the corner, I discovered, to my intense alarm, that the laundry was missing and with it the disgusting aftermath of my ordeal."There's also," she said quietly, guiltily perhaps, "a type of oatmeal soap that does much the same thing as salt water. Good for allergic reactions such as yours." With great deliberateness, she gently took my hand in hers, rolled the sleeve back up, lifted my arm and turned it over to swab the sores on the underside. "I'll pick some up at a pharmacist today.""I can do that for myself," I told her, nodding at my arm. I propped myself up by an elbow with every intention of claiming the towel, but had to fight to keep from vomitting. How could she stand to even look at that pin-cushion arm, dotted with festering wounds? How could she tolerate to be a second in my pestilential room, ripe with the smells of human filth and disease?"David?" she said.Still contending with nausea, I hissed, "Aren't you afraid of catching something?" "I think it's time we took you to hospital."The royal "we"."Your fever hasn't broken," she said. "It's been so many days now; almost a week by your count, isn't that right? I mean, a hundred and five over the last two days, and who knows for how long before we started taking readings. You seem to be getting weaker. I just think it would be better to get some professional attention. That's all."Who did she think she was coming into my room while I slept, shifting my things around, taking them away? Even in a sense taking possession of my body. How could I not have awoken at the very first touch of her hand or application of the wet towel? Was I dead already?"David," she came again."Nice rocking chair," I complimented Florence Nightingale. "Yours?" "Will you ... at least consider?"I looked up again, prepared to lay on, intent upon knocking her off her high horse, knocking out a few teeth, figuratively if not literally, but then my stomach tightened, and I folded over, retching into my mouth. Feeling utterly unable to get up and walk to the bathroom, I forced myself to swallow the vomit back down. It was then, when I couldn't resist sneaking a peek at her eyes to register the horror and revulsion, that I saw that those eyes were steady and without a discernible trace of horror, revulsion or pity.That very day, I was examined in the emergency ward of Stanford University hospital and admitted as a patient. I was treated for exhaustion, which required an IV, and given a whole host of antibiotics, anti-histamines and ingested steriods for my array of severe but curable disorders. In the evening, Anka joined Erin in my room. Once my fever was down to a manageable level the next morning, I requested immediate release, and the doctors, aware of my financial status, agreed. Erin brought me home in a taxi. She escorted me to my room and actually held onto an arm as though I were a frail old man. I entered that familiar cell to find my clothes neatly folded and stacked on top of my futon, which was just as neatly made. There too was the ceramic bowl and, inside of it, a freshly laundered hand towel for swabbing my skin, the responsiblity for which I could now assume for myself.I was truly grateful, but at the same time, so utterly unable to repay her either monetarily or through favor, that the burden of obligation weighed upon me like an anvil upon an ass.A little over a week later I spied Erin exiting one of the law school lecture halls, a modern building of brick and glass. "Hello!" she cried spotting me at the bicycle rack almost instantly upon clearing the swinging double doors.Taken aback by her sniper's acumen, I raised my right arm, covered to the wrist by a buttoned sleeve, and inadvertently swung the plastic bag hanging from the wrist and bounced the hefty plastic food container inside against my elbow. "Hi," I said sliding off the tubular bike rack and walking to meet her.She was smartly but casually dressed in dark jeans and a brilliantly white cotton shirt with not the slightest wrinkle. From her shoulder hung a satchel of flawless black leather. "What are you doing here?" she asked.I held out the plastic bag as a legitimate admirer might a bouquet of flowers. "For you.""What is it?" she said accepting the bag, and the unexpected weight caused her hand to dip so abruptly that the bottom of the box actually banged against the ground. "What is it?" "Just some lunch.""Lunch?"The initial trickle of well-dressed, well-groomed students coming out the building had swollen into a steady stream, so I backed away from the pedestrian traffic, drawing Erin after me. "You never leave home with anything," I said with a shrug. "And this morning when I asked, you said you weren't taking any money either." Eyeing me suspiciously, she said, "So that's what that was all about. Hm. You know ... you're not my mother.""I just thought," I tried to defend myself, "I just thought ... ""What's in here anyways?" she asked mercifully.With deepest appreciation, I answered, "A bed of rice--""Queen size? Or King?""--a bit of squid with scallions, egg plant in mushroom soy and sugar, steamed chicken with ginger and garlic sauce, very light."Her jaw dropped, and it took a moment or two for her to regain composure. "Thank you so very much, but ... why?" I cleared my throat. "Well, you did prepare a lot of meals for me while I was sick.""I ... I ... never made anything like this! Which is hardly surprising since I could barely heat the cans of soup that I did prepare for you. Who taught you how to cook?""My mother."She smiled.A tall young man in a light green sports jacket came up to Erin and tapped her on the shoulder while casting me a congenial smile. His wavy strawberry blonde hair shone in the sun, making me acutely aware of the unwashed black mat on top of my head. "Hey," said the young man, "what's up?""Oh, hi Brian!" chirped Erin.I looked down at my paint-spotted cargo fatigues, resplendent with frayed holes over the knees. While they covered my frightful skin, they could not hide my lowly social status."Brian," she said, "this is David."Brian extended his hand, which I accepted with a smile, hoping that he would not notice the blood stains on my sleeve somewhat camoflaged by the shirt's plaid pattern in hues of blue. "Nice to meet you," he said. "Nice to meet you," I replied. As we released, I thought I detected a flicker in his grin and suddenly remembered that my hands were coarse as sandpaper. Turning to Erin, I said, "Actually, there's probably enough for two." I felt an urge to add that I had washed my hands thoroughly before cooking, but instead, I examined my watch without reading the time. Then I told my benefactress, "I've got to get going; there's a lot on my calendar for the rest of the day. See you later." "See you," she said looking a bit perplexed. I tried hard not to hurry across the courtyard. The day was very bright, but perhaps because I was now more a creature of the basement than of open air, the sun's warmth through my tee-shirt pricked and irritated me. I finally reached a long stone verandah and, in its shade, started walking faster, passing people left and right. A heavy tap upon my shoulder caused me to stop and swirl round to find a bearded middle-aged professor paying me no notice as he marched by. A tap on the opposite shoulder caused me to turn again; this time I found Erin, breathless with mischief."Geez, am I glad to get rid of him!" she said. "Didn't want to spoil my appetite." She held up her bagged lunch. "You said there was enough for two.""Yeah," I confirmed."Well then ... join me?""I'm not that hungry," I said. "I already ate a bit. That's for you."Erin squinted to study my face. "What are you about anyways? Trying to fatten me up to get me married off or something?""Nooo." "Then come on. Help me out with this. I couldn't possibly handle all ten kilos by myself. That is, if you can spare the time. You did say you were busy."She had taken my improbable lie at face value. Grateful for this blithe trust, I confessed, "I'm not too busy."We sat down on the rim of a circular fountain. I'd forgotten to pack chop sticks, but luckily there was a campus cafe within sprinting distance. When I'd retrieved a pair of plastic forks plus paper napkins, we tucked into the meal. I was careful to modulate my pace despite my hunger, not because I'd claimed I'd already eaten but because I wanted her to eat her fill without concern for the recent invalid. Alarmingly, the conversation soon stalled. Despite the amounts of time we'd spent together over the past few weeks, this was, oddly, our first real opportunity for two-way conversation. After a minute or so that grew increasingly awkward with every passing second, I said, "I noticed that this morning's paper was opened to the 'Dear Abby' and horoscope page.""Uh huh," confirmed Erin with a rascally smile."You were the last one with the paper," I ventured, "weren't you?""Well ... yes."I paused to see what she might add, but another intimidating silence seemed in the making, so I hastily continued, "Did you read the horoscope?" "Yeees." "Hm." Of late, I myself had been given to consulting the stars on a daily basis. "I thought lawyers were supposed to be like super rational."The junior attorney wrinkled her nose. Prodding and poking the food with her utensil as a Chinese might do before finally settling on a gleaming chunk of eggplant, she carefully intoned, "I realize that what they print in the paper isn't necessarily accurate."Scooping a modest clump of plain white rice myself, I said, "Then some horoscopes are  accurate?"As she chewed, Erin gave a little nod and said quite tentatively, "Perhaps." Swallowing her eggplant, she reached into the Tupperware box and resolutely forked a wiggly tentacle of squid."You're superstitious," I said with the relief of finding a fellow believer. "Of course, the Reagans consulted a professional medium. As did Hitler."Erin's eyes widened. "Is that what you think of lawyers? Hitler?!""No!" I immediately responded. "That's not what I--""What one believes," she said wagging her skewered tentacle in front of my nose, "is one's own choice. No. Not even. Sometimes it's predisposition. A personal tendency. Innate. And nobody can be guilty of the subconscious.""Course not," I concurred in clumsy retreat from a position I hadn't meant to defend in the first place."No one should be made to apologize for harmless tendency," she rolled on, chewing fiercely and impaling a small cube of chicken. "Why should they?""They shouldn't!" I blurted, the rice sliding off my fork and falling on my lap. While in the process of gobbling her chicken cube, she added, "I have ... in fact ... had accurate readings ... by reputable palmists."Brushing off the rice, a thought occurred to me: "What's a 'reputable' palmist"? But I didn't dare give it voice."The accuracy of these forecasts," she said as though addressing my thoughts, "were borne out by events. I've had good, meaning 'reliable' tarot card readings, and you might be quite interested to know that the most intriguing and correct prediction I've ever had the good fortune and privilege of receiving was made using a Chinese method.""Oh!" I gasped, sensing a potential opportunity for escape.She started prodding the steamed rice. "Do you know about the poem calculations of ... of ... what's his name?""Zhu Ge Liang," I offered eagerly, and Erin looked at me with yet bigger eyes. "He was," I elaborated, "possibly the greatest military strategist in all of antiquity. East or West. Once, with but a handful of geriatrics at his command, he turned away a giant invasion force. Ruses, you see. Tricks and ruses.""Yes, yes," she said dismissing the tricks and ruses. "You knew right away! You knew exactly what I was talking about!" She planted her fork into the rice like a regimental standard on the field of battle.  "There's this book!" she said excitedly stirring the air with nervous fingers. "An ancient book with, I don't know, a few thousand Chinese characters?""Perhaps ten thousand," I said. "At least!""And you have to think of three words? Any three words? The first three to pop into your head. Like, um, 'frog', 'green' and ... 'avocado'.""'Frog', 'green' and 'avocado'?"She pursed her lips and furrowed her brows. "Okay then....  'Sky', 'blue' and ... 'seven'."I stuck my fork into the rice too. Pressing my left arm across my mid-section to support my right elbow, I used my right hand to play with my lower lip, squeezing it between my fingers as I might a ripe grape. "You see," I explained assuming a professorial air, "the problem here is that most words in Chinese consist of two  characters, not just one. Sometimes even more than two characters. So thinking up three things will likely result in more than three characters."Erin frowned deeply."But we do," I quickly retreated, "take single characters as sort of 'abbreviations' or 'contractions' of multi-character words.  I mean, we use short forms. All the time."My lunch partner leaned backwards a bit and smiled. "You've obviously had a poem or two done in your time.""Well," I said smugly and stuck my hands into my pants pockets. Losing sight of the fact that we were perched on the rim of a fountain, I leaned back too, very nearly tumbling into the water, but managed to extract my hands just in time to whirl my arms and regain balance. "Hey, wait a minute!" she said sitting bolt upright, apparently unimpressed by my helicopter imitation. "Maybe you know how to do it yourself! Do you!?"I glanced over my shoulder at the water and answered, "No."  The plethora of twinkling coins at the bottom of the fountain instantly presented a minor temptation, and the thought flashed through my mind to return late that night with a ski mask and plastic bag.Screwing up her face in disappointment, she said, "Oh," and slouched forward."You understand," I angled, "what it is they do with those three characters?" "No.""You count up the number of brush strokes in each of the characters you've thought up, then you add up all three numbers. With the total sum you perform a certain calculation."She looked up again.  "And?""And the calculation gives you another number, an integer, which you write down. Then you repeat the original calculation on it. This results in a new new number. You repeat the whole thing over and over again until.... um ... more squid?" Smiling slyly, she freed her fork from the rice and skewered another chunk of eggplant. Holding up the morsel, she waved it in circles before her nose to breathe in its bouquet. Then she shut her eyes and laid it on her tongue, purring, "Mmmmm." Opening her eyes again, she said, "Go on.""Anyways," I resumed, struggling briefly to regain my train of thought, "in that ancient book of thousands of seemingly random characters, you look up the ones that correspond to the numbers you've just calculated, and what you finally end up with are either strings of pure nonsense, a real rarity, or lines of perfect poetry. Amazingly coherent, literarily correct and wonderfully lyrical poetry. Their sentiment and meaning invariably address the issue that occupied your mind in the first place. The accuracy, as you yourself noted, can be uncanny.""You do  know how to do it," whispered Erin in awe. "No," I insisted. "I don't.""Can you do mine?" she hurriedly asked. "Oh, please!  I haven't had one done in ages!"I flicked a wayward grain of rice from my chin. "I don't have the book," I said. "I mean, even if I happened to remember the algorithm, which I don't, what could I do without the book?"She pouted, defeated for the moment, but then her eyes narrowed and the corners of her mouth curled into a grin. "So what did your poem say?""Which one?" I asked."You lucky man. To have had so many.""Not 'many'.""The latest one!" she cried. "Tell me the latest!"Now it was my turn to frown. "Well," I began slowly, "I suppose that would have to be before I went to Australia. Can't remember the thing line for line, but I suppose the general sentiment went something like ..." (I cleared my throat) "...'Fleeting spring, lasting winter. Flower buds that shrink and die.' Uuuh. That's all that's still there. In my head, that is.""What does it mean?" asked Erin, now a little uncertain and possibly even concerned. "Was it ... accurate?"The poem's final two lines ran "'Cannot trust the warm, sweet wind. Hold tight your cape against summer snow.'" How precisely Mother had calculated my future, the future of our small, stranded family. My homecoming had been the briefest and most ephemeral of springs, and now the winter was upon me in a land of sunny climate. I had yet to build a shelter for Father, who lay buried in the snow. Smiling at my companion I said, "I'm not sure."She raised her brows, and what struck me as a look of sad recognition came over her face. Although she was merely arching her back, she seemed slowly to be drifting away, like a ship cut loose from its mooring. "Be careful," I said reaching out a hand to keep her from falling into the fountain. "Whoa." Her smile returned, but this time with contrived mirth."So how about you?" I asked. "What did your latest poem say?" "Just the one," she answered flatly, lifting a leg and slipping her hands around her kneecap. "Just the one.""Expensive in London?" I inquired with a stupid chuckle.Both her feet off the ground, she teetered on the fountain's rim. "Not really.""That's alright," I said. "You don't have to tell if you don't want to."She shut her eyes, and her phony smile broadened. "As I recall, it said something to the effect that I was destined to be a raider.""A what?" "'Raider'," she repeated. "As in marauder.""You mean like ... Viking or hell's angel.""Funny you should mention Viking." She quickly opened her eyes again and cocked her head back to look up at the sky. "I'm half Norwegian.""Oh?" I said as her head began to dip and her body to roll. I laid a hand beneath her back to lend gentle but firm support. "Mother's side or father's?""Father's," she answered, then suddenly threw her head and body forward, landing both feet on the brick-laid ground with a startling clap. "Mother, both aunts, grandma, all other assorted relatives, school chums, work associates, the entire bloody society in which I grew up and have until recently been embedded are English. Yet I believe I am quintessentially Norse.""You mean Norwegian.""Same thing," said Erin with a shrug and strange half-grin. "At least as far as I'm concerned.""Usually," I said, "the fortune verses are either very coherent and relevant or complete nonsense. I mean, I can't remember them ever being coherent and nonsensical."Erin looked at me coolly. "You assume my fortune to be incorrect?"Shaking my head, I chuckled nervously. "I mean ... I don't know.""Marauder," she repeated pedantically. "One who travels far to sack and pillage. A destroyer! As a young man my father crossed the North Sea to execute a daring little raid on old London. He came away with my mother's heart, figuratively speaking. You could say that through what he did with that heart, figuratively, he destroyed her life. Though I've never met the man, I do sense that we are kindred spirits."For some moments I considered these remarks, the veritable tip of an iceberg. "What were the lines exactly?" I asked."I ... I can't recall," faltered Erin. "Honestly." Then she non-chalantly shrugged her shoulders. "I guess I retained only the figurative interpretation.""Uh huh." Erin smiled demurely and looked down at her hands, which were now resting flat upon her lap.Two Skies     uv You hit the ball against the wall in front of you, to the two walls to either side, to the ceiling above, to the wall behind.rsation had all been in my head.aunc&'7;v| s v  !j!m(())*l*p112i2v3331393=3@5D5J5Y5b556666"777777:3::;;;O;S;;====>;>?A-A/D2D4DHDKGGHuH|IIJaJgO1O5UUY<Y>Y?YMYNYOYRYSP@ZYSYZY[YYYfhhi`iaj!j$jBjajjjk8k:k;kQkRkkklblcm_m`mmmnxnnoo1o2ooopppq&q'q7q8qqrrr)r*rmrnrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrssss=s>sCsDsZs[sesvssssssssss@_&'=w>B[\]P3%t/u%]5O2l  z !|!!""##$$&n&'()y)))*j*t++++-...0000Y.///0:1@12`23;3q4R45R56.678589;E;r<<"<>X>n??@A7B>BBBCCDEGH)HGHIZIJJ'J6JjKLHNNO9OrOP!P[PPQ|QQQRnST{TTUUV"WX7XXY=Y>YOYPYQYRYS&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@0SXSYSt%l%,4R<KCKHRXSP@ .P!@"P#M@$jP%S@&P'"@(P)m@*YSYZ-..YS/0U/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH@Rd(hh@YSY[YYYfffffHfffg g!gAgBgghhi*i`iaj"j#j$jk;kRklcm`o2q'q8qr*rnrrrrrrrrss>sDs[sssssvvvv@vBvPvnvwv|v}vvvvvvvvwwww"wBwWwnwvwwwwxx'xJxSxxx0\Ses Erin in Chinese dress (not lavender) and Chinese street scene.

He lay there literally without a care in the world, without a care whatsoever, allowing his human waste to dribble down his buttocks, to soil the edges of his drawn down pants perhaps, the edge of his cot perhaps. He lay there without stirring a muscle when the man servants came to prod him, came to raise his eyelids to see if the pupils were constricted, to see if they could still detect with their hands, with a feather held up to his nose the trace of breath. He lay there when the local magistrate came into the room with a folded over silk scarf held tightly over his nose. He lay there when the household boys snuck in to look at a living corpse. He lay there when he imagined the spirits of strangers floated by to inspect a future companion. He lay there when the light of the sun warmed his cold body. He lay there when the light of the moon colored him over like a fine wash of white glaze a rough terra cotta statue. He lay there as his grandmother far, far away went about her business without the slightest inkling or perhaps too concern of what was happening to him her grandson. He lay there as Lan Enzhang walked about with apparent ease now that her once-bound feet had been uncurled, now that they had healed, possibly sparing a few minutes of the day to wonder about the young post master who had saved her from a life of domestic drudgery, possibly sparing for him an ounce of longing, a tinge of affection.

7#$%fL'C*\*\8888J;(;(;(;4;J;Z;Z;x8*<^ <~@*@8@< @@L2@@@@@@Chapter 10: Erin didn't seem to me like a modern Kiwi girl, who though not audacious and spunky like your modern Aussie girl, was nevertheless not so formal, so prim and proper, so careful and fastidious as this young woman. Erin might have stepped out of an old black-and-white movie, your stereotypic prim and proper Brit. Despite this image, I never associated her with Britain either. Not crumpets and correct manners, not cricket games and cucumber sandwiches, not royalty and princesses. But, instead, whenever not in her company, whenever not confronted with her actual physical presence to contradict and short-circuit my mental projections, I pictured the girl in a Chinese dress, just like the one I'd dressed her in on the morning of the burnt toast and circular holes in plywood. Whenever she was not in my room, I imagined her, with the utter vividness afforded by binoculars, in dark blue silk down to her calves, the slit sides providing glimpses of her legs to the thighs, Erin walking with the careful, fastidious gait of a Chinese woman not wanting to reveal too much of the legs thus prone to exposure. I watched her move in a Chinese fashion, circulating about the house with very little noise, almost like a forest creature on padded feet. I saw her carrying objects, a teapot perhaps, in her hands with the elbows extended away from her sides, making her bent arms appear almost as small wings. Her shiny dark hair was pulled back from her forehead and done up into a bun in back. She did what she had to do in the kitchen with quiet efficiency. She sat at her desk for school work with diligence and concentration. I had never before really lived in a Chinese household, unless you cared to call the East-West trench warfare of my family a "Chinese household", so upon what exactly did my mind base this vision? This fantasy of rational behavior? And what, I had to ask myself, was my role in the scene? What if anything but the invalid, the patient? That which made the caregiver heroine heroic?I saw Erin washing chopsticks at the sink. I saw Erin writing a letter with a wolf's hair brush and smelly Chinese ink. I saw Erin peeling an orange with her slender fingers. I saw her sitting on the edge of the tub as it filled with water, dipping into the water with her hand to insure that it was nice and hot, stirring it around to make uniform the temperature. I saw her selecting vegetables at a street market stall. I saw her bartering with the vendor for a favorable price. I saw her in a book store reading the first few pages of a book to gage her interest. I saw her walking home beneath the shade of tall trees. I saw her stepping up the stairs leading to the front door of our share house. I saw her descending the carpeted stairs leading to our basement quarters. I saw Erin in the dozens of tasks that constitute a typical Chinese day, in settings mixed Chinese and American. I saw Erin fast asleep at night, her head upon her pillow in a darkness that could not obscure her from my vision. I saw her snug beneath a thick silk quilt. The street light-cast shadow of strands of bamboo, the sharp tipped bamboo leaves nodding on the wall beside her bed. A little over a week after my recovery I spied Erin exiting one of the law school lecture halls, a modern building of brick and glass. "Hello!" she cried spotting me at the bicycle rack almost instantly upon clearing the swinging double doors.Taken aback by her sniper's acumen, I raised my right arm, covered to the wrist by a buttoned sleeve, and inadvertently swung the plastic bag hanging from the wrist and bouncing the weighty plastic food container inside against my elbow. I slid off the tubular bike rack and said "Hi." I moved forward to meet her.She was smartly but casually dressed in faded jeans and a brilliantly white cotton shirt with not the slightest wrinkle. From her shoulder hung a satchel of flawless black leather. "What are you doing here?" she asked.I held out the plastic bag as a legitimate admirer might a bouquet of flowers. "For you."She said, "What is it?" accepting the bag, and the unexpected heft caused her hand to dip so abruptly that the bottom of the box actually bounced against the ground. "What is it?" "Just some lunch.""Lunch?"The initial trickle of well-dressed, well-groomed students coming out the building had swollen into a steady stream, so I backed away from the pedestrian traffic, drawing Erin after me. "You never leave home with anything," I said with a shrug. "And this morning when I asked, you said you weren't taking any money either." Eyeing me suspiciously, she said, "So that's what that was all about. Hm. You know you're not my mother.""I just thought," I tried to defend myself, "I just thought ... ""What's in here anyways?" she asked mercifully.With deepest appreciation, I answered, "A bed of rice""Queen size? Or King?""a bit of squid with scallions, egg plant in mushroom soy and sugar, steamed chicken with ginger and garlic sauce, very light."Her jaw dropped, and it took a moment or two for her to regain composure. "Thank you so very much, but ... why?" I cleared my throat. "Well, you did prepare a lot of meals for me while I was sick.""I ... I ... never made anything like this! Which is hardly surprising since I could barely heat the cans of soup that I did prepare for you. Who taught you how to cook?""My mother."She smiled.A tall young man in a light green sports jacket came up to Erin and tapped her on the shoulder while casting me a congenial grin. His wavy strawberry blonde hair shone in the sun, like that of Apollo himself, I so imagined, making me acutely aware of the unwashed black mat on the top of my own still-scabby head.  "Hey," said the young man, "what's up?""Oh, hi Brian!" chirped Erin.I looked down at my paint-spotted cargo fatigues, resplendent with frayed holes over the knees. While they covered my frightful skin, they could not hide my lowly social status. While Brian was gazing into Erin's eyes, I tried inconspicously but quickly to unroll my sleeves and cover my arms down to the wrists."Brian," she said, "this is David."Brian turned to me quickly and extended his hand, which I accepted with a smile, hoping that he would not notice the blood stains on my shirt sleeve only somewhat camoflaged by the shirt's plaid pattern in hues of blue. "Nice to meet you," he said. "Nice to meet you," I replied. As we released, I thought I detected a flicker in his grin and suddenly remembered that my hands were coarse as sandpaper, tattered as they were from work and tearing at them myself. Turning to Erin, I said, "Actually, there's probably enough for two." I felt an urge to add that I had washed my hands thoroughly before cooking, but instead, I examined my watch without reading the time. Then I told my benefactress, "I've got to get going; there's a lot on my calendar for the rest of the day. See you later." Before she could ask "Busy with what?" or even think of such a question, I turned and walked away. "See you," I heard her say, the sound of her voice perplexed. I tried hard not to hurry across the courtyard. The day was very bright, but perhaps because I was now more a creature of the basement than of open air, the sun's warmth through my tee-shirt pricked and irritated me. I finally reached a long stone verandah and, in its shade, started walking fast, passing people left and right. I shut my eyes and saw the long revolutionary, in his high-collared tunic, marching with purpose down the covered walkway of a liberated imperial garden. The walkway was divided into a series sections, a octagonal pavillion conecting congruent sections. Passing from walkway to pavillion, he looked up at painted panels depicting the route of the destruction of Chao Chao's fleet on the Yangtze, black smoke rising from the burning ships, armor-laden men jumping into the frothing white waters of the mighty river, famished for human lives to extinguish. The young revolutionary made his way at brisk pace from pavillion to pavillion, taking in each colorful scene of carnage and slaughter, of disaster for one side and victory the other. The sum of all parts always caneled out to exactly, precisely zero.  A heavy tap fell upon my right shoulder, causing me to stop and swirl around to find a bearded middle-aged professor paying me no notice whatsoever as he went by. A tap on the left shoulder made me to turn again; this time I found Erin, breathless with mischief."Geez, am I glad to get rid of him!" she said. "Didn't want to spoil my appetite." She held up her bagged lunch. "You said there was enough for two.""Yeah?" I struggled to catch her up. "I mean, yeah, there is. Should be anyways.""Well then ... join me?""I'm not that hungry.

7#$D48N\N\t333?:y"'x[ * 2Chapter 10: Florence NightingaleA little over a week later I spied Erin exiting one of the law school lecture halls, a modern building of brick and glass. "Hello!" she cried spotting me at the bicycle rack almost instantly upon clearing the swinging double doors.Taken aback by her sniper's acumen, I raised my right arm, covered to the wrist by a buttoned sleeve, and inadvertently swung the plastic bag hanging from the wrist and bounced the hefty plastic food container inside against my elbow. "Hi," I said sliding off the tubular bike rack and walking to meet her.She was smartly but casually dressed in dark jeans and a brilliantly white cotton shirt with not the slightest wrinkle. From her shoulder hung a satchel of flawless black leather. "What are you doing here?" she asked.I held out the plastic bag as a legitimate admirer might a bouquet of flowers. "For you.""What is it?" she said accepting the bag, and the unexpected weight caused her hand to dip so abruptly that the bottom of the box actually banged against the ground. "What is it?" "Just some lunch.""Lunch?"The initial trickle of well-dressed, well-groomed students coming out the building had swollen into a steady stream, so I backed away from the pedestrian traffic, drawing Erin after me. "You never leave home with anything," I said with a shrug. "And this morning when I asked, you said you weren't taking any money either." Eyeing me suspiciously, she said, "So that's what that was all about. Hm. You know ... you're not my mother.""I just thought," I tried to defend myself, "I just thought ... ""What's in here anyways?" she asked mercifully.With deepest appreciation, I answered, "A bed of rice--""Queen size? Or King?""--a bit of squid with scallions, egg plant in mushroom soy and sugar, steamed chicken with ginger and garlic sauce, very light."Her jaw dropped, and it took a moment or two for her to regain composure. "Thank you so very much, but ... why?" I cleared my throat. "Well, you did prepare a lot of meals for me while I was sick.""I ... I ... never made anything like this! Which is hardly surprising since I could barely heat the cans of soup that I did prepare for you. Who taught you how to cook?""My mother."She smiled.A tall young man in a light green sports jacket came up to Erin and tapped her on the shoulder while casting me a congenial smile. His wavy strawberry blonde hair shone in the sun, making me acutely aware of the unwashed black mat on top of my head. "Hey," said the young man, "what's up?""Oh, hi Brian!" chirped Erin.I looked down at my paint-spotted cargo fatigues, resplendent with frayed holes over the knees. While they covered my frightful skin, they could not hide my lowly social status."Brian," she said, "this is David."Brian extended his hand, which I accepted with a smile, hoping that he would not notice the blood stains on my sleeve somewhat camoflaged by the shirt's plaid pattern in hues of blue. "Nice to meet you," he said. "Nice to meet you," I replied. As we released, I thought I detected a flicker in his grin and suddenly remembered that my hands were coarse as sandpaper. Turning to Erin, I said, "Actually, there's probably enough for two." I felt an urge to add that I had washed my hands thoroughly before cooking, but instead, I examined my watch without reading the time. Then I told my benefactress, "I've got to get going; there's a lot on my calendar for the rest of the day. See you later." "See you," she said looking a bit perplexed. I tried hard not to hurry across the courtyard. The day was very bright, but perhaps because I was now more a creature of the basement than of open air, the sun's warmth through my tee-shirt pricked and irritated me. I finally reached a long stone verandah and, in its shade, started walking faster, passing people left and right. A heavy tap upon my shoulder caused me to stop and swirl round to find a bearded middle-aged professor paying me no notice as he marched by. A tap on the opposite shoulder caused me to turn again; this time I found Erin, breathless with mischief."Geez, am I glad to get rid of him!" she said. "Didn't want to spoil my appetite." She held up her bagged lunch. "You said there was enough for two.""Yeah," I confirmed."Well then ... join me?""I'm not that hungry," I said. "I already ate a bit. That's for you."Erin squinted to study my face. "What are you about anyways? Trying to fatten me up to get me married off or something?""Nooo." "Then come on. Help me out with this. I couldn't possibly handle all ten kilos by myself. That is, if you can spare the time. You did say you were busy."She had taken my improbable lie at face value. Grateful for this blithe trust, I confessed, "I'm not too busy."We sat down on the rim of a circular fountain. I'd forgotten to pack chop sticks, but luckily there was a campus cafe within sprinting distance. When I'd retrieved a pair of plastic forks plus paper napkins, we tucked into the meal. I was careful to modulate my pace despite my hunger, not because I'd claimed I'd already eaten but because I wanted her to eat her fill without concern for the recent invalid. Alarmingly, the conversation soon stalled. Despite the amounts of time we'd spent together over the past few weeks, this was, oddly, our first real opportunity for two-way conversation. After a minute or so that grew increasingly awkward with every passing second, I said, "I noticed that this morning's paper was opened to the 'Dear Abby' and horoscope page.""Uh huh," confirmed Erin with a rascally smile."You were the last one with the paper," I ventured, "weren't you?""Well ... yes."I paused to see what she might add, but another intimidating silence seemed in the making, so I hastily continued, "Did you read the horoscope?" "Yeees." "Hm." Of late, I myself had been given to consulting the stars on a daily basis. "I thought lawyers were supposed to be like super rational."The junior attorney wrinkled her nose. Prodding and poking the food with her utensil as a Chinese might do before finally settling on a gleaming chunk of eggplant, she carefully intoned, "I realize that what they print in the paper isn't necessarily accurate."Scooping a modest clump of plain white rice myself, I said, "Then some horoscopes are  accurate?"As she chewed, Erin gave a little nod and said quite tentatively, "Perhaps." Swallowing her eggplant, she reached into the Tupperware box and resolutely forked a wiggly tentacle of squid."You're superstitious," I said with the relief of finding a fellow believer. "Of course, the Reagans consulted a professional medium. As did Hitler."Erin's eyes widened. "Is that what you think of lawyers? Hitler?!""No!" I immediately responded. "That's not what I--""What one believes," she said wagging her skewered tentacle in front of my nose, "is one's own choice. No. Not even. Sometimes it's predisposition. A personal tendency. Innate. And nobody can be guilty of the subconscious.""Course not," I concurred in clumsy retreat from a position I hadn't meant to defend in the first place."No one should be made to apologize for harmless tendency," she rolled on, chewing fiercely and impaling a small cube of chicken. "Why should they?""They shouldn't!" I blurted, the rice sliding off my fork and falling on my lap. While in the process of gobbling her chicken cube, she added, "I have ... in fact ... had accurate readings ... by reputable palmists."Brushing off the rice, a thought occurred to me: "What's a 'reputable' palmist"? But I didn't dare give it voice."The accuracy of these forecasts," she said as though addressing my thoughts, "were borne out by events. I've had good, meaning 'reliable' tarot card readings, and you might be quite interested to know that the most intriguing and correct prediction I've ever had the good fortune and privilege of receiving was made using a Chinese method.""Oh!" I gasped, sensing a potential opportunity for escape.She started prodding the steamed rice. "Do you know about the poem calculations of ... of ... what's his name?""Zhu Ge Liang," I offered eagerly, and Erin looked at me with yet bigger eyes. "He was," I elaborated, "possibly the greatest military strategist in all of antiquity. East or West. Once, with but a handful of geriatrics at his command, he turned away a giant invasion force. Ruses, you see. Tricks and ruses.""Yes, yes," she said dismissing the tricks and ruses. "You knew right away! You knew exactly what I was talking about!" She planted her fork into the rice like a regimental standard on the field of battle.  "There's this book!" she said excitedly stirring the air with nervous fingers. "An ancient book with, I don't know, a few thousand Chinese characters?""Perhaps ten thousand," I said. "At least!""And you have to think of three words? Any three words? The first three to pop into your head. Like, um, 'frog', 'green' and ... 'avocado'.""'Frog', 'green' and 'avocado'?"She pursed her lips and furrowed her brows. "Okay then....  'Sky', 'blue' and ... 'seven'."I stuck my fork into the rice too. Pressing my left arm across my mid-section to support my right elbow, I used my right hand to play with my lower lip, squeezing it between my fingers as I might a ripe grape. "You see," I explained assuming a professorial air, "the problem here is that most words in Chinese consist of two  characters, not just one. Sometimes even more than two characters. So thinking up three things will likely result in more than three characters."Erin frowned deeply."But we do," I quickly retreated, "take single characters as sort of 'abbreviations' or 'contractions' of multi-character words.  I mean, we use short forms. All the time."My lunch partner leaned backwards a bit and smiled. "You've obviously had a poem or two done in your time.""Well," I said smugly and stuck my hands into my pants pockets. Losing sight of the fact that we were perched on the rim of a fountain, I leaned back too, very nearly tumbling into the water, but managed to extract my hands just in time to whirl my arms and regain balance. "Hey, wait a minute!" she said sitting bolt upright, apparently unimpressed by my helicopter imitation. "Maybe you know how to do it yourself! Do you!?"I glanced over my shoulder at the water and answered, "No."  The plethora of twinkling coins at the bottom of the fountain instantly presented a minor temptation, and the thought flashed through my mind to return late that night with a ski mask and plastic bag.Screwing up her face in disappointment, she said, "Oh," and slouched forward."You understand," I angled, "what it is they do with those three characters?" "No.""You count up the number of brush strokes in each of the characters you've thought up, then you add up all three numbers. With the total sum you perform a certain calculation."She looked up again.  "And?""And the calculation gives you another number, an integer, which you write down. Then you repeat the original calculation on it. This results in a new new number. You repeat the whole thing over and over again until.... um ... more squid?" Smiling slyly, she freed her fork from the rice and skewered another chunk of eggplant. Holding up the morsel, she waved it in circles before her nose to breathe in its bouquet. Then she shut her eyes and laid it on her tongue, purring, "Mmmmm." Opening her eyes again, she said, "Go on.""Anyways," I resumed, struggling briefly to regain my train of thought, "in that ancient book of thousands of seemingly random characters, you look up the ones that correspond to the numbers you've just calculated, and what you finally end up with are either strings of pure nonsense, a real rarity, or lines of perfect poetry. Amazingly coherent, literarily correct and wonderfully lyrical poetry. Their sentiment and meaning invariably address the issue that occupied your mind in the first place. The accuracy, as you yourself noted, can be uncanny.""You do  know how to do it," whispered Erin in awe. "No," I insisted. "I don't.""Can you do mine?" she hurriedly asked. "Oh, please!  I haven't had one done in ages!"I flicked a wayward grain of rice from my chin. "I don't have the book," I said. "I mean, even if I happened to remember the algorithm, which I don't, what could I do without the book?"She pouted, defeated for the moment, but then her eyes narrowed and the corners of her mouth curled into a grin. "So what did your poem say?""Which one?" I asked."You lucky man. To have had so many.""Not 'many'.""The latest one!" she cried. "Tell me the latest!"Now it was my turn to frown. "Well," I began slowly, "I suppose that would have to be before I went to Australia. Can't remember the thing line for line, but I suppose the general sentiment went something like ..." (I cleared my throat) "...'Fleeting spring, lasting winter. Flower buds that shrink and die.' Uuuh. That's all that's still there. In my head, that is.""What does it mean?" asked Erin, now a little uncertain and possibly even concerned. "Was it ... accurate?"The poem's final two lines ran "'Cannot trust the warm, sweet wind. Hold tight your cape against summer snow.'" How precisely Mother had calculated my future, the future of our small, stranded family. My homecoming had been the briefest and most ephemeral of springs, and now the winter was upon me in a land of sunny climate. I had yet to build a shelter for Father, who lay buried in the snow. Smiling at my companion I said, "I'm not sure."She raised her brows, and what struck me as a look of sad recognition came over her face. Although she was merely arching her back, she seemed slowly to be drifting away, like a ship cut loose from its mooring. "Be careful," I said reaching out a hand to keep her from falling into the fountain. "Whoa." Her smile returned, but this time with contrived mirth."So how about you?" I asked. "What did your latest poem say?" "Just the one," she answered flatly, lifting a leg and slipping her hands around her kneecap. "Just the one.""Expensive in London?" I inquired with a stupid chuckle.Both her feet off the ground, she teetered on the fountain's rim. "Not really.""That's alright," I said. "You don't have to tell if you don't want to."She shut her eyes, and her phony smile broadened. "As I recall, it said something to the effect that I was destined to be a raider.""A what?" "'Raider'," she repeated. "As in marauder.""You mean like ... Viking or hell's angel.""Funny you should mention Viking." She quickly opened her eyes again and cocked her head back to look up at the sky. "I'm half Norwegian.""Oh?" I said as her head began to dip and her body to roll. I laid a hand beneath her back to lend gentle but firm support. "Mother's side or father's?""Father's," she answered, then suddenly threw her head and body forward, landing both feet on the brick-laid ground with a startling clap. "Mother, both aunts, grandma, all other assorted relatives, school chums, work associates, the entire bloody society in which I grew up and have until recently been embedded are English. Yet I believe I am quintessentially Norse.""You mean Norwegian.""Same thing," said Erin with a shrug and strange half-grin. "At least as far as I'm concerned.""Usually," I said, "the fortune verses are either very coherent and relevant or complete nonsense. I mean, I can't remember them ever being coherent and nonsensical."Erin looked at me coolly. "You assume my fortune to be incorrect?"Shaking my head, I chuckled nervously. "I mean ... I don't know.""Marauder," she repeated pedantically. "One who travels far to sack and pillage. A destroyer! As a young man my father crossed the North Sea to execute a daring little raid on old London. He came away with my mother's heart, figuratively speaking. You could say that through what he did with that heart, figuratively, he destroyed her life. Though I've never met the man, I do sense that we are kindred spirits."For some moments I considered these remarks, the veritable tip of an iceberg. "What were the lines exactly?" I asked."I ... I can't recall," faltered Erin. "Honestly." Then she non-chalantly shrugged her shoulders. "I guess I retained only the figurative interpretation.""Uh huh." Erin smiled demurely and looked down at her hands, which were now resting flat upon her lap.Ses Erin in Chinese dress (not lavender) and Chinese street scene.

Then I bounded down the hallway stairs and into the basement. I ran past the open door to my room and down the hall.  Stopping before the closed door at the end of the long corridor, I knocked."Yes?" came Erin."It's me," I said. "Your fellow subterranean."The door swung open, and Erin, smiling, bowed low and swept her arm upwards like a ballerina dancing a swan.  "Entre.""Guess what?" I said. Stepping across the threshold, I spotted Anka sitting cross-legged on the bed. She gave me her standard crooked smile. Erin pushed me backwards until the backs of my legs hit her wicker rocker, until I was seated and swinging back and forth. But then when I popped up again, she said, "What?" I handed her the legal-size writing pad previously on the rocker seat. "Sooo-ry. I'm afraid I squashed it." "You can't squash something that's flat to begin with, but I must say, you did do a pretty decent bending job." She held up the angled tablet."So what is it?!" asked Anka. Erin sat down in the office chair before her desk.Still on me feet and raising a brow for dramatic emphasis I announced, "Today I got a job.""A job!" cried Erin clapping her hands."Yeap.""So the big danger in looking for work has finally happened," said Anka in mock solemnity. "No, really.  That's great, Chich-kou. Wonderful.""Tell us about it!" said Erin bouncing in her chair."Well," I began, "it's not a very good job, but it's steady." The fiction I had invented for Father flashed through my mind, but the sky had been merciful. The letter was no long a lie, a trick. The fairy tale was beginning to come true. "I think it's actually like ...  a work-study position for undergrads; I'm a little surprised I was eligible. I mean, I'm not even enrolled." I looked down at the carpet. "I think maybe the woman who hired me kind of liked the idea of having a Ph.D. under her.""Then it's at Stanford?" asked Anka."Yep.""Oh, good," said Erin. "You won't have to commute.""I can ride my bike""And come home every day for lunch. I'll make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Now that I can do."Anka rolled her eyes. "So what about the job?"Redirecting my attention to the artist, I said, "It's part of a program mainly to develop high school curricula on other cultures. You know. Educational packets? Workbooks and stuff like that? Do they have those in Poland." Anka frowned. "They're also working on international arms control. That's the specifc project I'll be on."Erin stood up and came over to push me down again into the rocker. This time I stuck. She asked, "And what will be your personal responsibility?"I said, "I'm not sure yet," rocking back and forth. "The woman I'll be working for told me I'll start with filing and typing just to get me familiar with the place. But eventually she sees me as a researcher and writer."Erin gave two thumbs up and applauded again saying, "You'll have your name on top-brand stuff!""Maybe," I said, actually feeling a little embarrassed to be so proud of such a lowly position.  "Hey! You guys want another driving lesson?!"Erin wrinkled her nose. "I don't think so.""No, really," I said."Sure, why not?" said Anka. "I haven't had anything yet today. I'm still good for the road." She pushed down on her hands and swung her feet off the mattress.Suddenly, the bear-like Michael appeared at the door in his usual stylish and immaculate attire.Still on the bed, Anka raised her eyebrows, casting me a quick conspiratory glance. Then she looked to her massive friend. "Hey, baby. What's up?""What's up with you?" said Michael with a thin smile, virtually ignoring Erin and me."David just got a job," chimed Erin. "And now we're all headed out the door for a celebratory driving lesson. Want to come?""Love to," said Michael, still staring at Anka, "but I've got a previous engagement.""Oh," said Erin."With Anka, in fact." Anka smiled at me and then tilted her head backwards.  "Come on, man," she said. "Just a stupid movie. Can wait.""A date is a date," said Michael."A 'date'?" said Anka as though she had perhaps misheard. She screwed a finger into her ear and pounded the opposite side of her head, pretending to knock the wax out. Michael looked up at the ceiling in exasperation. "I meant an 'engagement'. A ... a 'shared activity'."Anka pushed herself off the bed and stood up, staring Michael square in the eyes. "Listen, baby man, you've got this nice white leash of coke and acid around my neck, so I'll always come running back. Don't worry. Dont worry about a thing. But for now I'm going driving. Beep, beep! Enjoy the freedom trip for a few hours while I'm straight. Go t it?"Michael laughed uneasily, for the first time looking self-consciously first at Erin and next at me. "Oh," he said in an even higher pitch than normally when stressed and pressed his hands together in front of his bulging belly. "If you want to go for a drive, then by all means. Do your little heart's desire. Afterall, that's rule number one for any little Sputnik. The prime directive."Anka took a step forward, and somewhat to my surprise, Michael managed to turn round before she could get past him and lead her out the door. The strange twosome marched down the corridor, Erin and I picking up the rear. As we paraded past the bathroom, where an errant towel lay on the floor, Michael said, "I think I'll go to hospital."Erin made a move for the towelher tidiness instincts kicking inbut I pulled her back into file. She shot me a dirty, untidy look.Anka twisted her head and smirked. She said "Oooh?" with feigned surprise and curiosity. "Hospital? What for, baby? Are you hurt? Bleeding from tongue?"Stopping at the bottom of the stairs but not looking back, Michael said, "I need to see Martin." "He still there?" I asked.Michael started to climb. "Want to come, Davo Boy? He's finally up to entertaining."I refused to answer as we ascended, creating tension for myself and pleasure for Michael, judging by his snicker. Reaching ground level, Erin said, "It might be awkward for a first-time meeting with a stranger. Even if a housemate of Michael's. Don't you think that in Martin's condition""I'm sure," said Anka, "that lovely Martin would want to be alone with Boo Boo." She pushed Michael from the back, trying to move him out of the way. Instead, he almost fell over forward, this time chuckling awkwardly to offset the clumsiness of the situation. Finally, Anka shoved past him and made a beeline for the front door."Charming little menage a trois," tossed the big man after her, like a little grenade the explosive of which had long since been removed through a hole drilled in its bottom.I wasn't really teaching either Erin or Anka how to drive. Anka simply needed some practice before testing. She was, in fact, already driving around unaccompanied quite a bit, sober or not, usually in my expendable Honda but also occasionally in Erin's royal blue Saab. And as for Erin, I knew from my personal experience in Australia that steering with the right hand while shifting with the left was about as easy as steering with the left and shifting with the right.  All it required was a bit of adjustment. During our highway sessions, Anka was perpetually primed for talking and hooting, but Erin banned conversation, at least while she was behind the wheel. She was terribly nervous on the congested, speedy Bay Area freeways and needed to concentrate. I had no trouble complying with her wish and generally neither did Anka. We both maintained a respectful calm, an effort for which I hoped she would reward us all by sparing our lives.  The life of the Honda, however, was really her's to do with as she pleased. I reckoned I owed her at least a demolition (provided it occurred at low speed, while parallel parking or three-point turning or something) since it was she who had loaned me the money to fix it. At last, I would soon be able to start repaying her.On this particular outing, we talked and laughed and even sang despite Erin's prohibition. I thanked God for the dry roads. During Anka's turn behind the wheel, she proved unusually steady, which may have been for her a bit of a personal disappointment. If it had been up to her, the roads would probably have been ribbons of ice.When we had had enough, Erin suggested a dinner to mark the occasion of my employment.  It was to be her treat. My debut as a surrogate work-study grunt hardly seemed a commemorable event, but she insisted. Anka, of course, displayed indifference. We drove to a posh Palo Alto restaurant, where Erin requested a private table, and we got a relatively secluded spot next to a gigantic Christmas tree.  The waiter took our orders for drinks.  Then he lit the candles on our table and left."Suppose," said Erin, "that you get one of those jobs you've applied for in Los Angeles."How delicate is my character that a bit of promised income can resuscitate self-esteem.  At last, I felt I had the right to at least admire Erin's beautyher fine fair complexion and silky brown hair, which hung down to the nape of her neck. The beautiful curve of her eyebrows, distinct but not detractingly over-full and dark. The nose, neither too large nor too small. The mouth, perfect in shape and color, always appearing soft and moist. Like a well mixed and baked cake? I chuckled and glanced nervously at the flames of the candles.  "I can almost picture this Christmas tree flamb." "It's not impossible," she persisted. "The L.A. job that is. Not the yuletide flamb."With my eyes, I traced again the outline of her lips, which I had once deemed just a bit thin but now struck me as absolutely exquisite. I resisted gazing too long at those large, luminous brown eyes, serene and enigmatic beneath long lashes. Normally, I might have avoided even looking in the direction of someone so rare, but Erin was too familiar to intimidate. "I guess for it to be flamb," I said, "it would have to be dowsed with brandy or something like that first before being lit.""Forget the flamb," groaned Anka, sporting her tilted smile."It's something that could happen," said Erin, and she abruptly pulled a sesame sprinkled breadstick from the bread basket. She seemed to tap the air with her breadstick wand. "There's a good chance.  Better than good.  You've worked hard researching those firms and tailoring query letters.""You only get A's for effort in school," I observed, throwing a quick sidewards glance at Anka.  "And besides, who reads query letters anyways?""They do read them," insisted Erin taking a quick bite of her breadstick and leaning forward in her seat. "At least some of the time, but that will be enough.""Oh, come on," interjected the realistic Pole, who crossed her arms, searching the room for something more interesting to look at than her conversationally challenged housemates."They will," reiterated Erin. "I'm positive. I've read those letters. They so succinct and compelling. They're eye-catching. Attention-grabbing. They inspire interest and respect. They create for the reader this perception of need that only the applicant can fulfill. They'll command the situation."Anka whispered, "Shit.""If they do," I said, "it'll only be because of your help."Anka huffed in annoyance and slapped the table.  "Why shouldn't she help you?" The volatile artist turned her hand palm up and raised it to me as though offering an make-believe dish. "You do all the cooking for her.""Some," I said."All, Chich-kou.""Most," offered Erin as compromise.I smiled uneasily and nodded. Erin looked down and smiled too.  "If I did the cooking," she said, "we'd have sublet flamb."Tickled by the rosy image this must have conjured for her, Anka relented with a chuckle.Visualize Erin in Chinese dressOf what I could see of the restaurant given the obstruction of the Christmas tree, it seemed patronized almost exclusively by well-to-do couples. From young to old, the men wore suits or, minimally, dinner jackets and the women fine dresses. Most everyone was smiling, and the atmosphere was filled with the murmur of civility. For once, even despite my casual clothes, I didn't feel necessarily out of place. And I wondered if I would still go. A real job with real benefits and a real future. A dress code too?  Bowing my head, I dismissed the dilemma as one I would probably not have to face in the foreseeable future."You tell me everything about your father," said Erin, "but next to nothing about your mother."Caught by surprise, I hesitated momentarily, but then said "My mother never talked that much about herself. Besides what I've already told you, I don't know that much more.""Were the two of you close?" asked Anka with a sneer. She picked up a black olive from a small dish of vegetables bits and squeezed it between her pearly teeth."I suppose so," I answered curtly. Lifting my head to peek at Erin, I found her still looking at me. "She's this tiny little woman," I resumed without turning away. "But way back in grade school I was even tinier.""Naturally," came Anka. "Unless she was Tom Thumb or Mommy Thumb."I turned to Anka in childish defiance. "I used to play in the band. I played saxophone, and my mother would carry it back and forth to school for me because it was too heavy for me." I looked again to Erin. "When I was older, she would sometimes ask me to take her to a movie on Saturday nights because she could tell how lonely I felt.  As though she really wanted to go for herself."Erin put her breadstick down upon the gleaming porcelain plate before her. "It seems to me," she said, bending her head slightly to one side and giving her place setting a demure smile, "that you know a great deal about your mother.""Why were you alone on Saturday nights?" asked Anka, staring hard at me. "Nobody like me around to baby sit you?"I drew a total blank: how to respond? Sitting there dumbly, I studied her hair, all spikes again, tinted green from gel."I'm real good at kiddy games," added Anka with big eyes, her lips oily from the olive. "You and me. We would have played real good together. Trust me. We could play good now."When I noticed myself squirming in my seat, I confessed, "I guess I didn't fit in. I mean, the friends I could talk to had all gone away for college, and my college classmates were ... I don't know ... didn't quite connect. Not the same species. Know what I mean?"Anka sat back in her seat, chewing her olives and smirking."Why didn't you go away for college?" asked Erin. "Isn't that sort of tradition here?" said Anka with an air of disdain. "Leaving home?""I guess so," I said. "But we didn't have that much money. I didn't want to take out loans." In truth, I had stayed home in part to maintain the uneasy truce between my parents, then still caught in the thralls of their cold war."Isn't going into debt also a local custom," observed Erin with a smile."Yeah," I said, relaxing a bit. "But you have to remember, we're Chinese. Same rules don't necessarily apply."Our waiter, a ruddy-faced young man, came towards us hoisting a round tray with drinks at shoulder level. At first it appeared that the order had been bungled since there were two glasses of white wine rather than a bottle and three glasses. But then to my even greater disappointment, he turned before reaching us and delivered the beverages to a table with a pair of men in business suits. "Why don't you go home, Chich-kou?" asked Anka."What?" I said."Why ... don't ... you ... go ... home?" She tossed another black olive into her mouth. "Where you belong.""Why don't you go back to Poland?" I came back at her. ""Poland?!" she spat. "I married a fucking asshole to get out!"I knit my brows and frowned disapprovingly at the language, which seemed too crude for present company. "You were married?" said Erin in astonishment."We applied for a honeymoon in India," she said. "We pretended to be having marriage problems.""So the marriage was a prop," I said, "a pretext for 'marriage problems', which in turn was a ticket out.""Obviously!" snapped Anka. "Big deal. We put our heads together to figure a way across the border, and then when we got over here..." She raised her hand to her mouth and blew across the palm. "Bye bye. This husband and wife thing." She laughed. "What a joke.""But don't you miss it?" I said. "Poland, I mean. It's where you were born."Our friend's body seemed to draw in upon itself: she coiled one leg around the other and crossed her arms, hugging herself tightly. She riveted her gaze to mine and began, "I'll tell you what I miss, Chich-kou: the trees, the forests and mountains. But the people?" She shook her head. "Huh-uh. Nobody. Not mother, not brother. I prefer animals. If they hate you, they claw you bloody; if they love you, they kiss you." She gave me a knowing nod and narrowed her eyes even more. "They don't hide anything. They can't.""Anka," interjected Erin diplomatically, "wants to live life to the fullest."No father, no sister. I felt envious and, for this, even more so ashamed. I wanted to share Anka's total disregard, to taste her complete abandon!"We've all got one thing in common," said Erin brightly. "Anka's not really Polish, I'm not really English, and you're not really American.  In fact, none of us has a nationality at all. Your country is your father, mine is my mother, and Anka's homeland is herself ... and her cat."This commentary brought a smile of genuine delight to Anka's face, and she put both hands on the table and pushed down with her weight as though she were about to stand up or pounce forward at Erin. Something about the attorney's summation, however, positively rattled me. "What are you talking about?" I said."Really," came Erin. "For you and I, the stories of our parents are our heritage; the wisdom and folly of their lives our earth, sometimes solid, sometimes not. For Anka, her heritage is her own story, which she writes every day.""Your country your mother?" I said with an involuntary sneer. "I mean, I thought you were 'Norse'. Daddy's girl." I shrugged my shoulders. "Who are you more like anyways? Who do you resemble?""I inherited my mother's face," said Erin, betraying a note of annoyance herself.  "We look somewhat alike, and you know, she still looks pretty fantastically good for her age. As for Pa Pa?" She picked up her breadstick and snapped it in two. "Well, he was already relatively advanced in years when he married Mother, but I understand that at the time he was trim and athletic. So maybe I'll get that from him.""That's not exactly what I meant," I said looking around for the waiter, but he was nowhere to be seen. At the extreme end of the room sat a silver-haired couple. The husband pushed his chair back from their tiny table, stood up and toasted his wife with a glass of bubbling champagne."You'll be beautiful face and beautiful body when you're sixty," said Anka, and she winked at her British/Viking friend."That's what I'm counting on," she said, blushing slightly."What if," I conjectured twiddling my thumbs, "you end up with his face and her figure?"For a moment, the woman attorney stared blankly at me, evidently non-plussed, but then she burst into laughter. "I always imagine," she struggled to say, "that he's quite ugly.... I mean, really hideous."Anka looked intently at Erin and said, "You mean you don't know?" Erin shook her head.  She giggled. "He took off the night I was born.""But you have photos, right?" I said. "At least of when he and your mother were together.""Nope," replied Erin.  "Mummy burned the lot."Anka seemed amazed, which I hadn't thought possible for her. But I felt the same. Erin had never really confided in us at all; it had merely seemed that way. The spry young attorney nibbled at the jagged end of one of her two breadstick halves. "Have either of you by chance ever read Egal's Saga?" "What's that?" I asked."Norse literature," she said. "The epic of a giant troll-like man and his somewhat heroic, undebatably bloody lifelong odyssey. If I recall correctly, he kills his first victim before the age of ten and his last at around seventy-five." Erin gave us a shy, sweet smile, the portent of which I could not even begin to fathom. "Centuries after his death, a Christian priest digs up his pagan bones and tries to split the misshapen skull with an ax only to crack the handle. Whenever I read that passage ... I see dear old dad."The three of us just sat there, completely unable to bridge the strange gap that had opened up between us, until, finally, the waiter came with our order--a bottle of white burgundy and three bell-shaped glasses.  He asked us whether we knew what we wanted for dinner, and I explained that we hadn't yet looked at the menus. As the waiter retreated, I poured the wine, sneaking another sidewards glance at Anka, who looked strangely solemn with her eyes half shut and her hands clasped together over her plate.  Looking to Erin, I found her grinning at me. With a carefree laugh, she looked down at her lap.I stopped pouring and leaned towards her, pressing my chest against the edge of the table. In my mind I whispered, "Anka and I have no cause but ourselves." Erin's smile dimmed just a bit, and her eyes widened.  She gave me the most curious look, as though startled, as though perhaps wondering, "What cause do you want?" In the end, I said nothing at all, but sat back again and looked away, my mind crowding with unspeakable thoughts. I wanted to take care of somebody.  I wanted to take care of her."Ambition," said Erin softly, "was given me by my mother.  But I suppose in an American vernacular you might simply call it 'energy' ... or maybe the will to survive ... in the deepest sense of the word. You see, I want to live forever."Anka snorted and pronounced, "Clich.""Perhaps," said Erin. "But I do want to do something extraordinary, something lasting." She turned to me.

The moth would flutter and make forward progress and be pushed a little backwards, a little forwards, a little from side to side until for reasons inexplicable, especially perhaps to itself, this insect consciousness aware not even of the moment, it alighted upon the leaf of potted plant, standing on a wooden pedastal, not two feet away from a gathering of three, seated around a small square table in one of  the courtyards of this garden restuarant.

Yet there sits her cup of tea, with just a bit of steam left to give. The shadows of the cups and teapot on the table are indistinct in a way, not falling in any specific direction, since the light now comes from all directions, surrounded as we are by paper lanterns. I notice the moths around the lanterns, like eratic planets around cylindrical stars, like sluggish electrons around curious nuclei. Anka'ssQuite honestlyof wine I am hungry, I am thirsty. But not really so much. My thoughts drift to that other engagement. With the hostess serene. Looking into my eyes, without the discomfort an anxiety that would visit a Chinese woman. Looking into my eyes as though it wee the most natural thing in the world. Which I suppose it is. The young woman is not so very hungry either. We have both lost our appetite. We have an appetite for something other than food. Not a carnal hunger, mind you, but a hunger for each other's company. The table between us dissolves to nothing; the walls of courtyard dissipate as if a morning mist burnt away by the rising sun. It is midday. We are in a city park, a place of grass and threes and a small brook. slightly open spacesThere are birds aplenty, darting from tree to bush, maybe even snatching insects out of the air. There is a brook, most neat and maintained, nearly straight in its course, hardly natural. But it glistens in the sunlight and exudes a coolness, a most welcome respite from the July heat. We are no longer host and hostess. We are walking side by side, not holding hands, but the hands do bump one another, now and again, and neither of us regulates the distance, preferring this accidental contact, wishing perhaps to somehow overcome the last vestiges of formality and separation.I can imagine the squirt of oily juice in her mouth. This time I must force my way back to that alternate existence. ,The is darkening a little, but not with clouds. I arch my neck and look up. Formations of planes seem to fill the sky. Those dragon lopster tails and square wings. But what is so terribly surprising here. It is, afterall, a time of war. What is surprising is that we could enjoy an meal at somewhere so fine as the garden restuarant. How is it possible that such places continue while simultaneously there are enemy working feverishly to bring about our demise, our destruction, our obliteration? There is the distant hum of the war machines, lower and more constant than the drone of hornets. The hum is all pervasive, all encompassing. It is as if the vibration of the molecules of the air is filling our ears. The sound is not maddening.

The high-pitched whistle of falling bombs. Growing louder and sliding down the scale as the round-nosed objects dive, dive, dive, boring down through the atmospere, too heavy and intent to be affected by eddies of air or turbulance. The innocent at ground level run for cover, but there are paths of intersection for trajectories horizontal and vertical. Not all will escape. It is a game of chance. Explosions rock the earth.

She uses them to push herself up too, to prop herself up, but unlike me, she cannot get to her feet, cannot seem to utilize her legs at all. I look. They are covered by blood and churned flesh. I start to blather: "Are you alright? How do you feel? Don't move. Don't even try to move. Be still. Stay still." My companion looks up. The Western girl, the jewel of the East is gone. It is, instead, my mother, as a young woman again, the face I know but from indistinct old black-and-whites, a face no older than mine, without a crease, without a line, expressing pain and agony only the eyes, the tortured eyes, and the mouth, from which comes no sound but only the occasional string of drool, the pain and terror being so great that together they smother her voice, or is it not do not permit her to articulate that which now occupies every corner of her existence.

She requested a ride to the flat of her ex-husband, who had to our surprise followed Anka to our sedate district from dangerous south San Francisco. Although she had originally left the city to get away from him, her ex now presented an alternative source of drugs to Mr. Avner, esquire. Erin and I said nothing and obligingly took Anka where she wanted to go.Afterwards, we steered ourselves to one of Palo Alto's stylish residential neighborhoods and parked the car to take a stroll.  As we walked, we talked briefly about my new job and then at length about Erin's study of the American version of common law. But soon she stopped.  "You aren't really listening, are you?" "What do you mean?" I asked with a guilty half-grin. "I've heard every word."She looked down and said, "Okay.""I was listening to begin with," I admitted. "But I guess ... I started to drift. I mean, afterall ... common law. Not exactly sports and entertainment."She half-grinned herself and nodded. "Not exactly." "Erin?" I said. "May I tell you something?""Of course.""It's a story.""Go on," she said, her smile turning wry. "I'm listening.""My father," I said a little breathlessly, "after the war. He fell in love with a young woman, a comrade in arms. Her name was Deng Lo-hua.  You see, they'd both gotten through the war alive. Obviously."She chuckled. "Quite."I looked beyond Erin at a large house, its hacienda-style facade lit up by small but powerful flood lights planted in the front lawn. To either side of the house stood dense files of tall firs. "For a time," I said, "they lived together in Beijing, in a small apartment. Very cozy. A regular nest by the way he talks about it. I know they were happy.""Rare," noted Erin pensively."I suppose.... Anyways, they couldn't exactly stand still, could they? I mean, they had to find something to do; they had to get somewhere in life. So they both sat for the entrance exam of their old academy, but only Father got in. And without her, he didn't want to go. Still, she persuaded him to go.  She compelled him. It seemed only sensible. If they were going to be married someday, one of them had to have a career.  So off he went, back to Nanjing, and she got a office job in Beijing. During the holidays, he'd hop a freight train to join her.""A freight train?" mused Erin. "I'll bet he showed up smelling like roses.""They weren't actually freight trains.  More like cattle cars for people who couldn't afford carriage fare. They'd sleep on bed rolls or newspapers. And I guess there were chickens and goats, mules and cows.""Actually," said Erin lowering her eyes. "It is  romantic.""Yes," I agreed. "He loved her. She was his reason for living. I know that sounds corny, but those long, dreary, smelly train rides were what kept him going because of what was at the end of them.  Not the cause, not the revolution or anything abstract." I fell silent, and we walked on for a time without a word passing between us. The homes we passed seemed uniformly impressive, their grounds uniformly emaculate. The neighborhood was hauntingly quiet, not a pedestrian in sight. It might have been a ghost town, but then I spied a man through a picture window. He sat in a cane recliner watching television. A young woman entered the bright room carrying a big plastic bowl of popcorn. Averting my eye, I finally resumed, "I guess I'm not making much sense."Erin shook her head and assured me, "You're making a lot of sense.""One holiday," I said, "when he got off the train and went to her apartment, their apartment, he caught someone coming down the stairs. It was her, but it wasn't her. I mean, it was the same person, but the face ...  powder, rouge and bright red lip stick. When he'd left her last she was still this girl with a face as fresh as dew, wearing the plain and simple clothes of a student.  Now he found a woman in a tight silk dress.""She was surprised to see him," said Erin quietly."Startled, I should imagine." I looked to my companion, but her face was turned away. "For Father," I said, "it must have been the shock of his life.  When he asked her where she was going, she wouldn't answer.  Instead, she led him upstairs to their flat, where she washed her face and changed back into her student clothes.  But it was no good; it was already too late.  Not that my father couldn't forgive her; he would have forgiven her anything, if only she would let him. In fact, he reasoned with her and pleaded, but it simply no longer mattered that he had left her alone in Beijing.  She needed certainty, which he couldn't provide. Did he really expect her to wait two or three more years at the risk of his then changing his mind? And then even if they did marry, what would happen when war resumed?  Would he go off to fight?  Would he be killed this time, and would she? It was no good waiting for the future.  She just couldn't. My father vowed to marry her next morning, to quit the academy, to never leave her again, not for a day!  If death did indeed come for them, at least it would find them together. He begged!... But nothing moved her."Erin seemed intently focused on the ground, so I wondered if she'd lost interest. Perhaps she was occupied with her own private thoughts or merely counting the cracks in the sidewalk."What Father didn't realize at the time," I whispered, "was that she was ... with child.""His child?" asked Erin lifting her head, her face working, an urgent, desperate cast to her eyes.Taken aback, I answered, "Don't know. Nor does he, and maybe Deng Lo-hua either.""A boy or a girl?!" she pursued."A boy," I said.She looked back down at the sidewalk, once more concealing her mask of confusion. "And ... who was this boy? What happened to them all?""Deng Lo-hua," I said, "married a man who she soon learned was already married.  This made her a concubine, which she couldn't bear. When she demanded a divorce, he took a knife to her face, then he pushed her out into the streets.  A little hunchback, a man from her office, took her in.  Later they married. Much later, during the Cultural Revolution, they disappeared. Including ... my half-brother? If he happened to survive, he would be ... mmm ... in his late fifties or early sixties by now. The hunchback had once been a secret agent for the Nationalists. I guess that's what marked them.""David?" said Erin."Yes," I replied trying to move into her field of vision and draw her eyes back towards me, but she looked away at a strange house with three colorful flags hanging from horizontal masts above the front door--a rose, an acorn and a crow."I don't understand," she said. "If the child wasn't you, then why are you telling me this story?""Although she wasn't my mother," I reconfirmed, "and if they'd stayed together I never would have been born, I still wish it could have lasted for him, even if just a little bit longer. Might have saved her, but I guess to me the important thing is ... it might have saved him.. You see, for a short time, he was the luckiest man alive."I turned once more to Erin, but she still looked away. Oh, how I needed to see those eyes, see what they conveyed. Windows to the heart. "Then it was darkness again. Disappointment and solitude."Suddenly, I realized I had said too much. Much too much. But what exactly was I really saying ? I couldn't quite figure it myself; I knew how I felt, and I felt a beggar. If only I could take back the words. Better yet, if only I could strike a blow! Fight somebody! I burned to be at the front.  But "the front"?  Was it a term that even made sense when the enemy was deep inside, intractable, like a virus? I wondered if I had ever really had the chance to be normal, to be well-adjusted, to fit into life?! I thought I had changed, but of course, I was the same. A dreamer of impossible dreams. Erin was as much beyond me as the moon is beyond an ape that yearns to fly. So this was the unambiguous lesson of two lifetimes, my father's and my own.Erin pulled me to a stop. She peered into my eyes for a few seconds and then looked towards a stone house with small dark windows, not so much as a candle flame to be seen inside."I often try to imagine what it would be like to live in other people's houses," she said."Maybe," I said hesitantly, "I do too.""I want a house full of light. Lots of windows to let the stars in at night." She turned to me again. "But if I got my wish for such a house, transparent with windows and glass, I imagine I might lose a bit of privacy. Expose the secrets which are my real shelter.... Now, you don't understand, do you?"I shook my head. She slipped her hands into mine and curled her fingers into fists. I rubbed her knuckles with my thumbs."For the first time in my life I know what I live for," I said.Shaking her head to stop me, she said, "If you finally go home, I'll understand.""No," I said shaking my head. "I won't."She dropped her gaze. "And I suppose ... I'll miss you." I held her chin between my fingers and slowly lifted her head."You see," she said, "I know what I live for too."I looked down at her face.  Her dark eyes were opened wide, perhaps for fear, because I knew she was offering her heart. At that moment, I was the luckiest man alive.It was past nine when we got home. One of our housemates, Jon, the fellow who lived on the other side of my wall was eating a late dinner by himself in the kitchen. I and Erin slipped past the entrance as quietly as we could manage and went down into our basement.I followed her to the end of the corridor and then waited as she unlocked and opened her door. As we stepped inside, I reached for the switch, but she said, "Don't. I can see alright. Can you?" The moon shone through the window above her desk.She turned around and stood there before me.  She undid the buttons on her blouse and slipped it off her shoulders. Her breasts were round and white, her nipples like small dark buds.  The shadows of her ribs heaved with every breath.  She kept her long slender arms by her sides, the skin textured by goosebumps.As she moved towards me, I bowed my head. She gently laid her fingers on my cheeks and touched her forehead to mine.  I rested my hands on her hips. We stood together like this for some moments, and then she raised my head again. Kissed me gently. I opened my eyes and saw a tear slide down her cheek."What's wrong?" I said."Everything," she whispered, choking on the word.She tugged on my shoulder to turn me around. With her arms wrapped about my waist, she pressed her face into my back.  "What is it?" I said. "Tell me.""I'm sorry," she said, shaking her head. "I'm so sorry."I struggled to face her, but she held me too tightly. I forced her hands apart. As I turned, she pushed me away.  Grabbing her blouse, she tried to move around me, but I caught her arm."Get away from me!" she screamed, and I let go.Just as she opened the door, I saw Michael's shadow flee across the wall.

7#$*F+62W2W9999X:M:M:M:Y:i::;x:M; ;?*@9?; ??F,??????Chapter 14: Nursing ErinAnka shouted for me; I had a phone call.  I left Erin's room and slowly climbed the stairs.  I passed by the living room and went into the kitchen. On one of the counters was a bottle of vermouth, some sliced lemon and an unused martini glass."Anka!" I hollered. "Did you forget your something?""What?" came her voice from the direction of Michael's room at the far end of the first-floor corridor."Your drink," I said. "And don't forget to wipe up the lemon juice.""Oh ... okay." Then came the jagged sound of her laughter."What are you doing in Michael's room anyways?!" I yelled. "Reading his diary or helping yourself to some stash? You know the guy's liable to show up again any one of these days."I waited briefly for reply, but none was forthcoming. So shaking my head I picked up the receiver.  "Hello?""Well it took you long enough," came a bright, perky voice.  It was Rene, one of my undergraduate office mates.I said, "Sorry to keep you waiting. What's up?""It's nothing that important; probably could've waited until tomorrow. But you're scheduled for the morning, and I don't come in until after lunch. So I just thought you might be able to use the information earlier.""Information?" I said looking back at the mess; I wasn't about to clean up after Anka again. The kitchen counter was spotless except for this one offense; I no longer had the slightest tolerance for disorder."Well it's not exactly information," she said.  "More like a situation.""Right," I said."Were you aware," said Rene, "that Helen read the units you did today?""Yeah? Well, how did she like them?"There was a pause."Didn't she like them?" I looked at the liquor again and debated taking it back downstairs with me. "Was that sort of a rough draft you submitted?" she asked timidly."No," I said. "It was a final draft. What was wrong with it?""Nothing as far as I'm concerned," said Rene, "but Helen ... I guess she ... kind of felt that maybe some of the grammar and construction could be ... um ... improved a bit.""Uh huh," I said, trying to keep my voice casual and nonchalant. Afterall, what were we talking about here? A constitutional amendment or high school curricula?A muffled sigh came across the line. "I thought if I called, you might be better prepared when you came in here tomorrow. Helen's not exactly a diplomatic boss, you know; in fact, she can be kind of ... straight forward, which is actually good in a lot of ways.""I guess." "And there's this thing posted up on the bulletin board.""Thing?""Um, critique perhaps? It's entitled ... 'Writing Rules for Dave'?""In red letters?""No," said Rene, her voice wavering slightly, sounding a tad bit hurt.Providing a light chuckle, I said, "I guess for it to be in red we'd have to have a color printer."  I fought off the terrific urge to rip some paper towels off the mounted roller and get at that lemon juice. "Yeah," said Rene. "I guess."For some weeks now I'd suspected that my boss wanted to fire me, but couldn't quite bring herself to it out of pity. I suppose the sensible thing to do might have been to quit of my own volition, saving everybody a hassle, but something in my nature dictated a different response. "Could you read it to me?" I asked. "I mean, if it's not too long.""Well I'm sure you already know all this stuff. Pretty elementary. I mean, I'm pretty sure Helen meant it to be rhetorical or something." Rene laughed awkwardly. "I could probably use the tips." Her long hesitation made me question if she was still on the line, but finally she began. Rule after elementary rule rang in my ear. And at the end, I thanked her.  She asked me whether I wanted her to take the notice down. I said no. After hanging up, I returned to Erin's room. The lights were off, and she was in bed, covered up to her chin with a patch-work quilt. Looking at the half-empty glass on the night stand, I sat down in the rocking chair beside her bed, the same one she had used while nursing me. Erin raised herself up to ask hopefully, "Who was that on the phone? Anyone we know?""No," I answered. "Someone from the office. Just routine.""Oh," she said and lay back down.I tried to smile. "Are you done with your brandy?" She closed her eyes and answered flatly, "It doesn't work anymore.""Maybe warm milk," I suggested hopefully."You tried that before the brandy. Remember?""It might work again.""All your solutions only work the first time." I made no reply. Looking up, I saw the full moon through the window; it was exactly one lunar cycle since our celebration stroll, our enchanted hour."I won't be able to sleep tonight," she said. "I can already tell. I'm a bloody authority." She turned to me, the corners of her mouth arched down.  "I'm beginning to lose my hair!" She carefully lifted a few strands for me to see. "Today in the shower, I pulled out a whole bunch. I didn't even feel it.  The hair just came out, like daffodil fluff.""Your hair looks fine," I said gently."It's dark in here," she countered.I chuckled. "I think I would have noticed a bald patch at dinner.""I didn't say all my hair.," she growled. "Just a bunch. You don't believe me, do you?"After a brief hesitation I said, "Yes I do.""You cook for me, you clean for me, you tuck me in at nights. You pretend to care about me, but in reality, you don't even believe me. What exactly do you think of me?  That I'm some sort of paranoid insomniac bitch?" Even in shadows, I could tell that her face was flushed..I bent over and rubbed my eyes hard with the palms of my hands. "No," I said. "I believe you.""What is it exactly that you want from me?" she hissed."What is it you want from me?" I fought back.We each waited for the other's answer, but none was forthcoming. So I got up to go, and Erin hurriedly said, "You have something to do?"I stopped in my tracks and fired back, "What's that to you?" but only in my thoughts. The words I gave voice to were "not really." Turning round again, I saw that the hostility in her eyes had given way to fear. "What's the matter?" I said, noticing the lump in her throat. For once I seemed in the superior position. "Alright. I'll stay a little longer. I'll stay until you fall asleep."I sat down once more, clasping my hands together on my lap. As I rocked, I studied an art deco poster on her wall, the every detail of which I could sketch from memory. For several minutes there was total silence, and it was all I could do to keep from jumping up and charging out the door. "David," said Erin with a softness that I had not heard in many weeks, that I had all but forgotten. I looked up and found her weary eyes focused on mine. "Do you remember when you were sick? You were no trouble at all. Never complaining. Hardly saying a word. I, on the other hand.... I'm so sorry to be like this. Truly I am. Strange illness. Fever without fever. Coldness without chill."In the moonlight, her pale skin resembled fine porcelain, her silky hair silver floss. Pulling with my heels, I slid the rocking chair across the carpet like a boat gliding over placid waters. Docking inches from her bed, I reached out to touch her hair, but she snapped, "Don't," and I jerked my arm backwards. "Please," she finished quietly and rolled over to face the wall.I crossed my arms and bent my head forward until my chin nearly rested on my chest. "Try not to think too much," I said. "Think about something pleasant. Something happy. To help you fall asleep."At sunrise, I awoke in the rocker.  To my surprise, Erin's quilt covered me up to my neck and kept me warm against the cold morning air. I looked over at her. She lay asleep beneath a woolly tartan of dark blue hues. In the dawn light the features of her face seemed unusually sharp and well-defined.  The color of her skin was now a gold tinted pink, no longer bloodless and sickly, her health miraculously restored.Pulling back the quilt, I rose from the chair without it creaking and moved steathily away, pausing for breath between each step. When I reached the window, I drew the curtain an inch at a time. Just as I shut out the last thin slat of sunlight, Erin stirred. She drew a bare arm out from beneath the tartan, but knowing it would only wake her, I overcame the urge to cover her up again.Steeling towards the door I realized just how disappointed I was that she had not awoken.  What was I expecting?  That she would call out my name, ask me to stroke her hair?  How I longed to sweep my fingers through her hair.I reached the door and turned back to her one last time. I whispered, "Got a job, a real job.  With regular benefits and a future. Just as you'd predicted. It's in Los Angeles where my best friend lives." I chuckled and rubbed my eyes with my fingers. "Chris doesn't even know yet. Maybe being close to him will help me. Doesn't seem like I'm doing you much good here.  If only I were  ... then maybe it would be different.... But I get the feeling that I may be doing you more harm than good. So perhaps it's in everybody's best interests if I go.... Then things will slowly get better.  You'll be able to sleep again and eat. You'll stop pulling out your hair and jumping at shadows. The sun will come out again. It's bound to."Or was it? Some people really didn't get better. And then there was the practical matters of the Saab and a pair of credit cards that had vanished with Michael. She had also lent him cash. How many days now had he been gone? I shut tight my eyes and shook my head. I massaged my temples until they hurt. "Don't even think about it," I mutely admonished. There was nothing to be done that had not already been done, and besides, she had plenty of money."This is my chance," I said, "to break from the past and move on. If I were my father, maybe I'd stick it out simply to bring Michael to justice.  And if I were my mother, maybe I'd stay through thick and thin even if you taunted and abused me, even if you hated and despised me because I know that at some level you really do care about me and I can help you. But I'm neither of them. I'm not of the same metal. I'm totally different. My first priority is myself. It really has to be. Don't you see? Survival."I stood for a fleeting eternity, but her eyes never opened.  Her body remained still as marble. So I pushed open the door and slipped out into the hall. In that instant, I made up my mind to go. A wave of supreme confidence swept over me, and this new-found strength enabled me to close the door so gently that it wouldn't have disturbed a fly.

7#$Xa`\`\<<<H(px< *7 J5Chapter 15: Hunter & HoundIt was now seven weeks since I'd taken up my sideline as an amateur detective, six since I'd sent a postcard to Chris breaking the news of my professional placement with an LA publisher and a little less than five since I'd phoned that firm to gratefully decline their offer. All these developments were rolled up into a dense ball lodged in the center of my consciousness as I led the big man back into his room."I'm surprised you didn't rent it out ," said Michael looking around at the surroundings as though they were strange to him."Well," I said unable to disguise my disgust. "Somebody kept paying the rent."He gave a quick laugh. "Wasn't me."Besides a few long strands of cobweb hanging from one end of the ceiling and a thick layer of dust visible on hard surfaces, the room looked the epitome of good if somewhat macabre taste.  Black were the curtains, carpet and bed spreads. A white plastic desk lamp in the form of a severed human hand holding up a glowing globe was the single source of light."Why don't you have a seat?" I said, taking one myself."Where did all the chairs come from?" he asked.  "Been having picnics in here? How nice. Ummm, I think I'll take this nice white one." He sat down.  "So who's got the picnic basket?" He snickered. "Or is it a guillotine basket?"Erin still stood by the door. "You come in too," I told her. "Take a seat." She responded immediately, which spared me from having to raise my voice, split my attention."Martinis?" asked Michael."The bartender is out," I said. "Anka missing, is she? Well then pizza? Anything?""How about answers," I said. "That would be nice."He narrowed his eyes and looked at the walls, which were decorated not with posters or paintings but framed musical scores. "Again with the answers.  Can't a man change his address without having to clear it with the proper authorities? This is the Soviet Union, isn't it?""You left everything," I said. "Your furniture, your clothes.""You can have them. Or you." He graciously indicated Erin with a wink. "Anything you like. I'm in the process of replanning my wardrobe. The shirt sizes may be a little roomy for either of you pretzels, but baggy's in fashion these days. Homeboy penitentiary style. Or maybe you could wear them together. Now there's a cozy thought. As for furniture and accouterments ..." He glanced at the nightstand upon which lay a silver piccolo, which he had never been heard to play. "Everything's in perfect condition, so take what you will. I'm redecorating my living space.""In short," I said, "redesigning your lifestyle." He suddenly growled, "Now look here Mr. Big Dick," catching me by surprise. "I didn't come here for an interrogation! You led me to believe that I was being invited back for a little reunion night cap or something!  I was on my way out for a little R-and-R at the Mars Bar, so if you don't mind, you can just chauffeur me there right this minute!""You live in a dump," I said matter-of-factly, slicing through his bluff. I looked to Erin. "He lives in this run-down downtown hotel. You know. The kind for derelicts." He had probably come with me out of simple fear. Surely not guilt or moral compunction. Hadn't even put up an argument let alone a fight.Michael seemed to calm immediately. He took out a cigarette from his small purse-like side bag and asked whether we minded him lighting up. Erin coughed quietly into her handkerchief, so I nodded. Michael smiled demurely and put his cigarette away again. "Look," I said to Michael. "Like I said in the car--""You call that a car?""Like I said in the 'Honda', this isn't about friendly nightcaps or interrogations or anything like either of those. All we want to know about are the things you took from Erin. The Saab, the credit cards, the cash.""And the rent," prodded Erin."Yes," I said. "Don't forget the rent for your room all these months.""Did you 'help me out' there, Little Miss Brit?" I gave him a quick nod."The credit cards have been taken care of," reminded Erin."Right," I said resisting the urge to roll my eyes.Not missing a tick, Michael glanced from me to Erin, then said, "Thank you, counselor," and curled the edges of his smile."As you probably know," I resumed, "the cards were canceled within hours of their disappearance, and the relatively modest amount that you did manage to charge before Erin notified the credit card companies has been covered by them. So the only thing there is the worry and inconvenience.""How much you charging for hardship?" asked Michael."That's a freebie," I told him. He lifted his brows, frowned and mouthed 'Ooo-kaaay'. "But the car and cash," I pursued. "Those are not trivial matters, even for Erin.""I commiserate with the poor thing, but I don't really know what you're talking about.  I haven't taken anything from anybody.""We've been to your parents' house," interjected Erin, upsetting my line of questioning. She was jumping way ahead. Michael's smile vanished; his expression became neutral. His hand moved towards his purse and the cigarettes but stopped short.  I quickly added, "That's right," and nodded vigorously for emphasis. "They're fine people, Michael. And you know, it really took some effort for us to track them down.  You don't use the same last name.""Then how do you know they're my people?!" he said, volume and pitch risely sharply."Settle down," I ordered. "We've been to the phone company. Your employer."His left brow twitched. "Former employer.""Quite right," I concurred."I resigned my post some time back. I'm restructuring my career.""You were fired. Or should I say 'let go', perhaps 'not rehired'?" I turned to Erin.  "Executives 'resign their posts', staff gets fired, but what do you call it when a temp worker's assignment is up and his contract isn't renewed?" Erin shrugged her shoulders; I turned back to Michael.  "Well, Mr. Junior Exec, that was thirteen weeks ago, shortly before the theft of Erin's car and your disappearance." Once more he seemed to regain equanimity, at least on the surface."You're not even their natural son," said Erin, again tripping me up. I looked to my partner, my mouth agape, and she turned to me with explanation: "Michael's got brown eyes. His parents both have blue. Blue eyes is a recessive trait, which means both parents carry only blue-eye gene. So where did Michael get his dominant brown-eye gene?" I paused to reason through her argument and then said, "Apparently not from either of them?" Erin nodded.For Michael, I noticed, this deduction had an effect. He started shifting his weight around in the chair. He attempted a smile but then let it go.  He pushed his dark glasses higher up the bridge of his nose. "Is that why you wear those shades?" I speculated. "To cover up your brown eyes? To hide the fact that you're either adopted or illegitimate?""I encourage you not to be a simpleton," he replied, the smile of confidence returning to his face yet again. My rhetorical question had somehow provided the hold he needed to regain balance. I felt more anxious than ever, but Erin's blank expression betrayed nothing.  Gathering my thoughts, I prepared for the next assault."You say you're gay," I said.He chuckled. "Not tonight I'm not, baby.""And yet for over a year you lived with a woman up in Portland.""How interesting," he said."Is that a denial?" I asked."No," he replied. "It's a conjecture, just like yours.""Is this conjecture?" said Erin, and she pulled a sheet of paper from her leather satchel and handed it to Michael. Craning my neck, I caught a glimpse; it was the address and phone number of Michael's ex. "You still write her letters," continued Erin. "On holidays you phone." After a brief, blank look at the page, Michael handed it back to Erin. Again, his expression was stony.I said, "If you're wondering whether we've had direct contact with her or not the answer is yes.""Nadine and I had a very nice chat one day," came Erin in a benign voice, as though in friendly conversation. She even gave Michael a reassuring smile. Michael, on the other hand, simply sat there, seemingly neither assured nor threatened."About Martin," I said."Martin's dead," he pronounced curtly."Yes," I instantly agreed, "but was the man ever alive? I mean, I know there are plenty of 'Martins' in the world, and one of them may even have been an old office mate or high school friend, but lover?...  A lover who tries to commit suicide over Anka?... A lover whose sudden death occurs just when we're all trying to get you to bring him around for a visit, just when we're all saying to ourselves, 'You know, we've never even seen this Martin character before.' Dropping like a fly put a quick stop to that.  So instead of our badgering you to bring him home, you were suddenly receiving words of sympathy and condolence, lots and lots of attention. But then we were left wondering, 'Was Martin a fantasy, a self-delusion, a sort of personal alternative reality or ...  a cover?' This last possibility raised even more interesting questions. For example, what was the ulterior motive behind all those substance 'favors' you provided Anka? And was it really just a tasteless joke that one day when you 'playfully' attempted to fondle her breasts?"My diatribe elicited absolutely no reaction to speak of from the bear. He sat there leaning slightly forward with his hands cupped loosely together on his lap. He might have been watching a TV talk show. As for myself, I was far from easy. It wasn't just the bad taste interrogation left in my mouth, it was also the awareness that I was quite intent on this game of cat-and-mouse. Moreover, the quarry was slipperier than I'd bargained for, and it certainly didn't help matters that Erin was proving to be the craftier fox, a more formidable predator. "Look," I said cutting to the chase, "this isn't about accusations and confessions; this isn't about morality. The whole set up--" I waved my hand in the air to indicate our homely interrogation cell "--precludes Erin and I from the moral high ground; we can't judge you. It doesn't matter to us one iota what you do and why.  All that really counts is your coming to grips with the true reality, the tab, which starts with the missing Saab and the three thousand two hundred fifty-five dollars and change. Which includes rent. Once the Saab is back out there in the parking lot, in its original condition of course, or cash to the amount of its current market value is in Erin's account along with the money you owe her then we'll be satisfied. And like I said before, personal hardship and mental anguish on Erin's part is a freebie." I looked to Erin, but she gave no sign. "Is silence consent?" I asked her.  "Does that pretty much sum it up?"After a brief hesitation, she nodded. "Good," I said, warily shifting my attention back to Michael.  "So what will it be?  Do you pay what you owe, or do we pursue this thing to its legal conclusion? Which could, I should add, conceiveably involve certain property concessions on the part of your parents."Oh yes. I did derive gratification. Misgivings aside, it was as though a long denied appetite was finally being sated. I was putting the squeeze on the vermin beneath my thumb. Now I knew just how badly I'd wanted to dash mercy all along. To shatter it against the rocks. To give full vent to justice, which is nearly as good as vengeance.Perhaps I anticipated a question from Michael such as the logical "what concessions?" That would have prompted a succinct and precise summation of the legal provisions for property confiscation from his parents.  I planned to blitz the man's defenses before he could reason things through since the weakness of our position would then become apparent. We had no real claim on any property of his parents because they were not legally responsible for their son; he wasn't their dependent.  And as for those possessions of Michael's that he kept at his parents' house, such as a baby grand piano, there were no bills of sale or other written documents establishing his personal, individual ownership. They too lay beyond our grasp. With a noticeable quaver in his voice Michael said, "Are you crazy or something?" His pose, with both hands knotted tightly together in his lap and his spine pressed against the backrest of his chair seemed to betoken considerable tension. He might have wondered whether we had found a loophole through which to take what we wanted. At this point Erin, cool as a cucumber, removed a second slip of white paper from her satchel. She said, "Please examine this item," and passed it to Michael. Within seconds his hands began to tremble. He held it out to me as though I were the bailiff, and taking it, I saw that it was a xerox copy of a bank check to the amount of $19,255 from Mrs. Kier, Michael's mother. "But how?" I said to Erin. "When?" She shot an angry look at me, as though I were an unruly child or yappy dog, and I was silenced.What a fool I had been! What a dupe! Fancying myself as something between a knight errant and personal P.I., doing my best on the lady's behalf, dashing an oh-so-rare career opportunity so that she could restore not just her property but possibly a little bit of peace of mind. So that she could perhaps at least begin again to sleep at nights. But in actuality, I was all along nothing more than a cog in the machinery of her secret agenda.During the chase I had done the running. She had held back until the quarry was flushed. And now that my part was fulfilled, she was making her move. Any further frenzy on the part of the hound would simply get in the way of the hunter. The hound couldn't be allowed to foul things up just as the kill was at hand!"This isn't the first time your parents have had to pay for your mistakes, is it?" said Erin coolly.  "Somebody else lost a car too, and your parents compensated for that.  Are cars interesting to you, or is it that you simply have a relatively safe way of converting them into cash?" Although he maintained his silence, Michael grew increasingly agitated. Tiny beads of sweat appeared on his hairline. He fidgeted in his seat and rubbed his knuckles.How incredibly, stupidly gullible I had been! What a ridiculous, misguided sense of purpose! This wasn't a dying woman; she wasn't connected to a respirator! My God, she had even warned me! In so many words. "Viking!" "Ruthless!" "Pillager!"  I had found them cute. Generation upon generation of the blind and deaf. How was it possible? What would it take to force a change, to make us understand? My father and I held on so tightly to myths, as though our lives depended on them, and yet to let go, all we had really to do was relax our fingers.Or was it that we couldn't let go? Neither Father nor I nor Michael because then we would be left empty handed. Because puffs of air were all that our lives amounted to. Michael's elaborate fantasies suddenly reverberated with unbearable dissonance.  "Do you know what your mother said to me the last time we met?" asked Erin.Michael managed a weak chuckle and said, "You never talked to my mother. If you did then you would ... you would ... know my nickname!"Erin giggled. "Your mother," she said, "refers to you as Michael, as we all do."Michael started fumbling around in his purse. "Not cigarettes," he said in a low voice. "I have asthma. I need my prescription.""I know you're adopted," said Erin."Not illegitimate?" came Michael in a cold and condescending voice.I trained full attention upon Erin. Since she already had her money, what exactly was this game about? Justice and revenge? Or something else? I had to learn the rules quickly. More importantly, I had to decide what part to play. What was my goal? To bring her  to justice? To make her pay?"It was your mother," said Erin, "who chose you above all the others they considered. Under the current circumstances another woman might regret that choice; I'm sure some would disavow it. And why not? There is some distance there. Not one's own flesh and blood. You could say that the ultimate basis of the relationship was purely legal. It wouldn't be like cutting off one's own arm. Perhaps more like discarding a faulty and troublesome prosthesis. That is, an artificial limb.""I know what the word means," said Michael, his eyes blinking, his hand clutching something in the purse."Your mother," continued the prosecutor, "never uttered a word of regret. Even as she broke into tears. The sole desire she expressed was for her son to call her again, to come home, to see her.... But then again, maybe she did want more. A kind word? A word of affection? Maybe there was no distance between the two of you, at least not from her perspective. Because she had eliminated it. In her heart. She had made you her true son. Which is why you repaid her the way you have.""YOU BITCH!" screamed Michael, and he sprang from his chair, pulling a palm-size dispenser of MACE or pepper spray from the purse and spilling the rest of its contents onto the floor.  Erin fell backwards in her chair and tumbled over. "Michael!" I shouted, and he turned to face me, his bright white teeth bared, his hand raised and a finger on the aerosol button. Despite the threatening pose, he was a ridiculous panda of man, and for a fraction of a second I wanted to laugh. Lunging forward, I kicked the MACE out of his hand. It shot to the ceiling and ricocheted off.The next thing I knew Michael's arms were wrapped around my waist in a bear hug. He pushed me back against the wall, which I slammed into with a boom that shook the house.  He tried to back away, to make his escape, but I held onto one of his wrists with both hands and yanked down on his arm with all my strength. He gave a terrific yelp as he dropped to the floor.I jumped on top of him, straddling the chest. Crossing my arms at the wrists, I thrust my fingers past his throat to grab hold of either side of his shirt collar. Now I had his neck scissored between my wrists. Twisting them, I could cut off the blood supply to his brain.  Within a minute he would lose consciousness; within three or four minutes he could be dead.  "I wasn't going to use it," he said, his voice bubbling over with fear and remorse.  He started to cry.  "I just wanted you to let me go."Erin crawled over to us and put her mouth close to Michael's ear. "The journal," she whispered.  "Where is it?""A journal?!" I said, relaxing my grip. "You mean like a diary? Is that what this whole thing is about?!"Michael threw me off. When I got to my feet again, he was already standing, very close before me, a tiny pen knife in his hand. His arm shaking, he jabbed the metal point at my eye, but I jerked my head to one side and caught his wrist with my hand.  He pulled hard; my grip slide to the blade, which sliced into my fingers. I kicked him in the groin, and the knife fell to the ground. I swept it aside, but in the next instant, he charged me again, grabbing my throat.  We rolled over backwards, and I ended up beneath him.My head was pounded against the floor by his great, bouncing weight. Was he reaching for the knife? I squirmed and kicked in blind terror.  He was much, much stronger than I'd anticipated. I summoned my will and, by some miracle, managed to throw him off.  For a second he sat on the floor like a dazed grizzly. I scurried towards him on all fours to wrap my fingers around his throat, pressing my thumbs into the soft of his windpipe, the blood from my hand smearing over his skin. With a mighty swing, he knocked me over.  He started to crawl away. I jumped on his back, looping one arm around his neck and drawing the fist towards my chest, clamping his jugular veins in the lever of my arm. He bucked hard, but I rode him harder. With my free hand I caught hold of my fist and started to pull, to squeeze. "You're hurting him!" I heard Erin say, and indeed I could feel his body slacken, the fight seeping out of it. I was now standing on my feet, half holding him up.I suddenly realized how badly I had wanted Mother to live, to keep on breathing if only for just a little longer. Now Erin was pulling at my hands, her face contorted in a scream, but I could no longer hear her. I was standing at the edge of a great rock, holding the arms of a boy poised to fall into the deep canyon before us.  The bottom was a mile below, and the boy said, "I want to go; let me fly." There wasn't a cloud to be seen, and the warm sunshine was the sky's invitation. I yearned to let go, to just let go, to let him fall, to be rid of Erin, be rid of my uselessness, my helplessness, the insanity. Generation after generation. Who was it that I held in the lever of my arm? Michael? The killer of father's heart Deng Lo-hua or the killer of mine Erin? Was it Father himself I was slowly extinguishing? Or was it me? With every critical second that passed, I plunged faster and faster, gravity hurtling me towards freedom, which even then I realized could only come when I reached the bottom of the canyon and he was dead. "HERE IT IS!" cried a fresh voice, and I looked up to find Anka.  She threw a thick book onto the floor; it landed with a thump. Its hard cover was black and titleless."NOW STOP IT!," she screamed. "YOU'LL KILL HIM!" I let go. Michael collapsed beneath me. A ring fell from Anka's hand and softly clattered on the floor. It was gold, set with a single topaz, deep blue. "He's dead," she said quietly. I stood up and looked down at the great mound of flesh. He lay still, with his head turned to one side. Soon, however, he began to stir. Erin, moving on her hands and feet, collected the book and ring. She looked up at Anka and asked plaintively,  "Did you read any of it?" "I took it," answered Anka. "But I didn't read a word.""Have you been home all evening?" I asked Anka."Yes," she said."Here," I said, my head throbbing with pain. "Help me with Michael."Erin pulled a handkerchief from her pocket and tied it around my bloody hand, which I balled into a fist to staunch the bleeding. With my good hand I felt Michael's neck to check for damage, and Erin helped me ease him onto his back. Anka put a pillow beneath his head. Erin covered his body with a blanket.Two Skies     vgot fired again, and an even month since I'd gotten fired.

The shelves and desk were gone. A small lamp with naked bulb stood on the floor in one corner. The only other furniture was the wooden chair in which I sat holding a letter from Chris.  It had been some time since his last communication. I opened the envelope and removed the letter. It read: October 1, 1987Dear Mr. Chinko Maginko,I am submitting the following poem entitled "Ode to a Cave-In" for consideration by your publication Zeros' Quarterly.Ode to a Cave-InIt all started one evening at the end of last SpringWhen Karen my lovely trashed the promises thing."I love you, dear Chris," she said late that night,"But 'forever' really makes me shiver, shake,cry with fright."She left for Saint Louie to see her old folks,And I became gluey standing at my cold post.No letters, no phone calls, not even a FAX.Night after night, really taking the whacks.When after a month she did finally ring,I was too frightened to hear all the tweety birds sing."I'm yours," she did coo as I stared at the faucet,"But be patient," she cautioned, and I knew shewould toss it.Day after day as I sat at my desk,I tested my zinger: "Could it still stand on request?"I was worried, you see, that the impotence thingWould its ugly head rear to give romance a ding.When she finally appeared at the end of July,I was happy to find that my hummer did fly.But the hole I had dug in the sand of my soulKept filling afresh with new worries and woe.What if, I conjectured, I forget how to sleep?Then insomnia would claim our late evening treat!I tried and I tried and I tried but alas,The winks did desert me; the nights shattered like glass.What if, I did question, I forget how to eat?Then din din would follow down the path of retreat.I tried and I tried and I tried but alack,The food made me nauseous: no more Mac attack.Karen did leave me at the beginning of Fall,But the hole kept on digging, headed for far Nepal.What if, I am asking, I forget how to speak?Then who will believe as I stutter and squeak?I'm trying and trying and trying to findA way to escape with a piece of my mind.So Dave, if you will, can you think of a way?Before the birds take me or I turn into clay?Please, Dave, my old friend, the clock tickstowards dawn.Their chirps do remind me that it may not be long.So, editor, will you buy it?  Further info is available upon request.Respectfully yours,Whiteman BignoseI refolded the letter and slipped it back into its envelope. I closed my eyes and breathed deep. Evidently, Karen had wronged him, just as Erin had wronged me. She had wronged me, she had wronged me, but I had wronged others. Here sat a convict. Guilty of cruelty towards Michael. Guilty of ingratitude towards Anka. Guilty, apparently, of trying to care for Erin when she didn't really want to be cared for. Guilty of both failing to punish Father and of abandoning him. Guilty of not doing what I had to do to save myself. Guilty of fabricating a counterfeit reality. A repeat offender, a habitual, a menace to the small, select society of my minuscule world. The square, aspirin-sized wafer of acid I had swallowed was already providing an aphrodisiac tingle at the tip of my zinger. Nothing I couldn't handle but rather distracting all the same.  The wafer had been a gift from Anka when I'd first joined the household, which meant that it probably ultimately came from Michael. With gratitude, I thanked them both.I decided to close my mind's eye and focus on nothing. To try to break the addiction of thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking.  I unlocked my jaws and opened my fists. I relaxed the muscles of my face and let my body slump in the chair. I paced my breathing and concentrated on an inner point of light that grew when I inhaled and shrank when I exhaled.My thoughts started pulling me backwards.  For a moment I alighted upon an afternoon more than a week earlier when I had helped Erin pack her things into large leather suitcases and carry them out to a waiting cab. Off drove the cab, and I slipped back once more, soon finding myself on a June afternoon six summers ago. I saw my youth corp work crew again, in the mountains of northeastern Utah.It was just past three, and the day's quota of logs had been surpassed even before lunch. My kids were hard workers, and the cut had gone smooth as usual. So I and the other crew leader decided to take them for a hike to a canyon that our maps indicated lay less than a mile due west.We walked through the pines in a loose body, our axes, chainsaws, rolling hooks and hauling jaws slung over our shoulders. The conversation was sparse due to exhaustion. As the forest thinned rapidly, something unexpected lifted my gaze from the ground.  A dozen more steps, and the sky opened up, like a melon broken over a knife-edge rock, and the ground fell away precipitously. There before us yawned a great canyon with rock walls of flame orange and a thundering river one thousand feet and more below. For some moments we stood transfixed by the utter majesty.At a small distance, the canyon wall on our side extended transversely out to form a sort of peninsula, a towering bridge that led to thin air. To a sheer emptiness the dimensions of which reduced me to an insect, a speck. I took the crew out onto this bridge, which couldn't have been more than fifteen feet wide at places. We walked to its end and stood high, high above the canyon floor. We stood over avalanche slopes of stone debris, produced by the violent conflict between gravity and solid matter. We stood above the river's scrubby banks, above a white ribbon of frothing, tumbling water, created by the violent confluence of gravity and fluid. After a time, after the awe had worn off a little and we were no longer dumbstruck by the sight before us, we all sat down, and the sunlight massaged our weary bodies.My fancy carried me back to Sichuan province and the enthroned Buddha cut into the side of a rock cliff overlooking the turgid brown waters of the Min River. We were no longer on some unknown natural curiosity in a forgotten corner of Utah but underneath the hot languid southwestern China sun, on top the crown of a colossus, his still brows and sleepy-seeming eyes below us, the heaven he "contemplated" or occupied through emptiness of mind or was a part of in some certain way above us. We dozed and drifted from dream to dream like butterflies roaming from flower to flower but somewhere within that giant granite forehead spun an infinitesimal point of lightall the questions and all the answers occupying the same intersection of planes. Total enlightenment and complete oblivion, everything and nothing. The stone gray skin of the Buddha began to shimmer in the sunlight, like a heat haze on a strip of desert highway. But then I realized that it was not a shimmering at all but an actual movement, a rippling perhaps, almost like that of the surface of a pond aggitated by a light wind. My eyes seemed to possess the power of magnification, and upon closer examination I noticed that the Buddha's cheeks and jaw, his lips and nose and eye lids and brow were covered by a multitude of tiny little wings, more or less triangular in shape, with rounded corners. In the next moment, the wings took flight. A stream or river of granite colored moths meandering up into the sky. The exact shape of the river kept changing, like a snake wreathing its way across a sky blue floor.The Buddha, his smooth skin a radiant flesh tone, the roots of his hair black, his crown a cone of white beads, remained as still as ever though I somehow knew that he breathed, that rich red blood circulated through his giant veins, that deep within his chest the size of a house a heart the size of a car pumped his blood to every giant limb. The Buddha's eyes remained half-open, half-shut. He did not blink. His mouth remained closed, neither smiling nor frowning. He spoke not, yet a voice reverberated in my ears, a voice resonant and lulling. It said, "First came time and space. Then came positive and negative."As if engaged in a cosmic nursery rhyme game, I responded, "The sum of zero. Beautiful is zero. Infinite is zero."And the Buddha said without saying, "All things. All things.""The sum is naught.""Good and bad.""Electron and proton.""Truth and lie.""Matter and anti-matter.""Pain and pleasure.""Gravity and anti-gravity.""Happiness and misery.""Heat, cold.""Life, death.""Past, future.""Man, woman."From the Buddha's head emanated a light that could not be seen but was nonetheless dazzling in effect. It was for me like staring into a solar eclipse, without damage of blindness. The light radiated out of Buddha's head like the light of a star, a growing, a flowering, an expanding, exploding halo. The immaterial arrows of light pierced every point on my body, every point of my head, like the shafts of an x-ray emission, exposing my inner structure, the contours of my conscience and consciousness.The light travelled outward and outward, upward and upward, through the clouds, through the layers of atmosphere above the clouds, carrying my consciousness with it, like a boy riding on the back of a photon, so that I saw that place where the molecules of gas were so few that each individual one appeared as a child's glass marble, one that only the hand of an atom boy could manipulate. Flight peeled away the last proverbial skin of the proverbial onion, the last faintly faintly glowing crust and membrane of gas, and I was of the earth no more, but in the black void of space, where the stars blaze like silent flares.I saw without seeing that I too had become a point of light, and gazing ever outward, I discovered that within my vicinity were a small number of other points of light, four to be exact, and these four plus myself a fifth belonged to a select group of lights the exact number of which I somehow knew to be thirty-six. The voice instructed me, "Look inward." I turned in the direction from which I had seemed to just come, and there, rotating slowly, majestically in space, was a super giant star of the most exquisite pale blue light, a great star to dominate my field of vision. Around this star revolved the thirty-six points of light, myself included. At some point in my path around the super giant I saw thirty-four of the thirty-five other lights, but the one little star I never could saw, number six to my number five, was on the exact opposite side of the super giant. Presumably holding me in orbit as I was holding it. So hauntingly beautiful was the blue of the star that I stared at it without cease, totally satisfied and fulfilled.A voice, a different voice, my own inner voice raised the question, "But is there another." I asked the blue star, "Is there another?"The master would not answer, not in words at least, but I understood it to mean that I should look if I wanted.I asked it, "May I?"It consented, not because it told me so but because I allowed me to know that it had. So I rotated on my axis, one hundred-and-eighty-degrees and there before me, occupying almost all of the sky, where before there had been but the Milky Way, was now a red giant large enough to dwarf the blue star ten thousand times over, with countless, maybe even limitless points of white light whizzing around it in super speed orbit.What was the blue? And what the red? Which was positive? And which negative?Good? Evil?God? Satan?My old childhood dream, ressurrected to confuse and befuddle me afresh. It made sense to me that Satan would have the multitudes, and how could I ever leave number six star, unseen to me yet critical to my being? But if I were in error.... If I were orbiting the wrong super giant.... The Judea-Christian dichotomy imposing itself upon the Buddhist order of nothingness. Could I not eliminate both super giants? Could I not see again the Milky Way for the Milky Way? "I'm going," I told the blue master.It did not answer."I'm going," I called out to number six star.My companion did not answer.Slowly, I drifted out of orbit, towards the red star, almost irresistably, just to try out an orbit around a different master, and could I always leave again if I wanted to? I approached that massive traffic of lights. Which seemed to accomodate me by allowing me to slowly meld into their motion.There was the red super giant, for as far as I could see in every direction. Its red light turned cooler, pinker."Hey!" brayed a most grating voice.I opened my eyes. A greasy-haired boy stood up and walked to the edge of the bridge to nowhere.  He climbed on top of a boulder and turned to face the crew.  "Hey, Mr. Zhou," he called out to me. "Look. I'm going to jump."He came from a broken family and threatened suicide or murder about twice a day.  The other kids ignored him. I stretched my legs out in front of me and crossed my feet at the ankles. I wedged my hands between my thighs."I'm going to jump!" he shouted. "I'm going to jump!" The kids looked to me. The other crew leader nervously insisted, "Just ignore him."But rather than heed her advice, I got to my feet, walked to the boulder and climbed on top to join the boy."I'm going to jump," he said, this time quietly, with an awkward little smile on his round, dirt-smudged face.I took hold of his shoulders. He gripped my sleeves. "If you want to jump," I said, "then jump." With stiff arms, I eased him towards the sky.  He shoved me backwards, and we dropped from the boulder.  For the blink of an eye, I was no longer imprisoned within the past, but speeding towards somewhere totally new. I was floating away, backwards, into the sky. At last. At last! On my way back to that place without dichotomies, without doubts and misgivings and impossible choices.Landing hard on rock, I opened my eyes again, and the boy, the canyon, the sky were gone. I was back in Erin's basement room. It was dark. In my hand was clutched Chris's letter. Outside the window, the waning light of dusk muted the neighborhood.There still lingered within my heart a vague sense of release and freedom, which left me only slightly puzzled. I could write to Chris and talk to him on the phone. I could even travel to LA. But I could not save him. And I wasn't even tempted to try. As I rose from my seat, I felt oddly powerful.  Fearless. Like a sky diver! But this sensation was merely the remnant of a memory of something that had never happened. Like a junky, I savored illusion and wanted more. The twilight sky assumed a yellow cast, like the color of a slice of tasty lemon pie. ***Unlike perhaps before, this time I fully realized what was happening, and I did nothing to fight it. This resignation to an existence of hallucinations, dreams and memories, including those not my own. It was better letting wild ambitions roam in illusion, letting them play out their fantasy lives where they could do no harm to real people. In effect, I was surrendering myself to a type of incarceration, similar in ways but also distinct from the one before. A captivity based on obvious fictions, mental facades, psychedilic hallucinations, rather than lies with a command and power over my life. That is, this time I would not be mesmerized and rendered a fool, a criminal.So this then was my sentence. I lifted my fists to stretch myself. I did my best to press Chris's letter flat between my hands. I went back to my own room and sat down before my desk, upon which rested the cassette player. It no longer bothered me that the machine was my opium pipe.As the cassette cog began to whirl, I shut my eyes and saw myself with smooth, painless stumps in place of hands. I shut my eyes a second time and watched myself retreat into a bright cage and lock the flower entwined door. Shutting my eyes one last time, I knelt down in my cage with arms bound behind my back and thick ropes wound around my biceps but held them loosely, comfortably. The captured insurgent quietly awaited punishmentto be buried most pleasantly alive.Two Skies     vnot disagreeablymy nighttime visitor from when I was five, an almost dailyother unfathomablerface of a pond aggitated by agranite colored moths meandered up into the sky.

7#$s|W|W-F(EExI i*1 Chapter 1: The Meeting of OppositesAs he lunged for "the kill", I leapt away from the spear's steel head and caught its shaft with a hand, sweeping my saber blade along the linear weapon towards my opponent's fingers. However, he retracted with more force than I'd anticipated, pulling my arm with him. My saber caught the base of my own thumb, the blade's sharpness precluding pain. Bright red blood flagged alarm. I instantly pulled up on the handle; otherwise, I would surely have severed the digit. "Stop," cried our instructor. He came over to us. "Let me see." Both I and my sparing partner raised ourselves up from combat stance.I lifted my hand for both men to see.  I reassured them that it was but a glancing wound, never mind the blood soaking into my shirt sleeve. They were not to concern themselves as I did not concern myself."You'll be alright," agreed my teacher, "but the two of you are mismatched. He's too slow, and you're too weak. Your grip and your stance. Not strong enough. That's why this happened. Next time, I'll have to find both of you more appropriate adversaries."Our master dismissed us, and we bowed to him. My partner and classmate offered to help me wrap my wounded hand, but I declined his kindness, thanking him with civility if not genuine appreciation. I sat down on a stone for some time, until the blood dried and caked. Then I put away my weapon and skipped class, going instead to the academy's art studio. At the art studio, on two long work benches to either side of my instructor, an old man confined to his wheelchair, lay five long sheets of clean, blank rice paper. With three different brushes wedged between the fingers of his left hand, the wasted cripple wielded a fourth brush in his right. This brush he dipped into a stone ink well filled with green pigment. The old master manipulated his rickety wooden wheelchair with such effortlessness and moved his brush with such speed and dexterity that my eyes could not keep up! The artist was painting five different pictures simultaneously, like a swordsman vanquishing five challengers. Small wonder he was the greatest master of three provinces. Within minutes there materialized before my eyes a stormy mountain landscape, a courtesan applying her powder in the privacy of her bed chamber, a herd of wild horses watering at a winding stream in the vast openness of the northern grasslands, a three-masted junk tossed like a toy by the raging sea, and four delicate rose blossomspink, saffron yellow, snow white and vermillionreaching at an angle for the mid-summer sun. Just as with the danger of sparring with weapons, the beauty of art distracted me for a time from the pain of my wound. Not the wound of my arm, of course, but that in my heart. A wound that refused to close and mend. When I beheld the handiwork of my master, for a brief time I was no longer simply breathing, merely existing. Sword play and brush work became the bi-poles of my existence: disparate yet identical. Like the two ends of a steel shaft heated and bent around to join and form a closed metal ring. As for the rest of my academic program ... well, course work and the ultimate goal toward which that leda degree and careerhad lost their appeal and significance, had completely faded in color like a piece of brightly dyed cloth left out too long under the beating sun. Other than sword play and brush work, most of my remaining waking hours were idled away on trifles. When my prolonged absence from classes became conspicuous to the instructors, Dean Lo was notified. Soon, I was summoned to his office.  Appearing before my keeper, I stood slackly at attention in front of his desk and awaited the questions or condemnations or formal notification of final, irrevocable expulsion. What I got, instead, was a bit of news."This school," informed the impeccably dressed dean, "is relocating to Kaifeng."Kaifeng in Henan province: an ancient capital of renown."As you know," said the dean, "the Japanese are now in Manchuria, and they have made aggressive moves in Shanghai. The battle for China has begun. This government can better persecute the war from an inland position." My superior looked down at a thick sheath of reports on his desk and sighed heavily. "Just as during the last crisis, classes will be canceled indefinitely, but this time, the cadets are going out to the counties of Henan to train the local militias.  Afterall, it's only a matter of time before the Japanese thrust at the heart of our country, and then we'll need all the men we can get. The officer who's coordinating this initiative is Mr. Zhang Ting-xiu, the provincial governor's chief secretary.  Ever heard of him?"I shook my head."Hm," grunted Dean Lo. "I thought perhaps you would have since he's not only from your home province of Guizhou but your hometown of Anshun.  You know, you could be a real asset to us acting as liaison between his office and this administration. Common background and all."I told the dean that although we might have been backward in Guizhou, the language we spoke was basically the same as his. Cruder perhaps in usage and inflection, but the academy would have no trouble communicating with Mr. Zhang; there was no need for my special services.Dean Lo considered me narrowly. "I believe," he said sitting back in his chair, "that that is up to you. Think about it; I give you a day. In the meantime, you might as well draft a letter of withdrawal from university."At the end of the day, I unaccountably accepted my new assignment. Soon thereafter the academy shifted to Kaifeng and I was in the thick of Zhang Ting-xiu's endeavor to mobilize local troops. While some of the county assignments were reasonably comfortable, many promised isolation and primitive conditions. Resultantly, the 'condemned' among my classmates filed through my room in attempts to wheedle more agreeable placement.I apologized to each and every one, telling them that there was nothing I could do for them. Begging innocence, however, seemed to galvanize the spreading rumors that the only one on whose behalf I was willing to intervene was myself.  "Mountain cousin" Zhang would see to it that I stayed in Kaifengthe seat of comfortwhere, in fact, I was just as miserable as when I resided at the academy. Even more so, in fact, since I was deprived of my twin escapes of fighting and art.I really did not exercise the slightest influence with Mr. Zhang, but through our association I did pick up the occasional bit of interesting news.  For example, the field reports that crossed my desk indicated that the only truly dangerous assignment might be Nei Xiang county, where a man named Bai Ting-fang had raised a private army of several thousand strong."Commander-in-chief" Bai, as he liked to be called, supported his forces with land duties collected from local peasants.  A small sum was set aside for the official county magistrate sent down from Kaifeng, but this was a wage of fear. The magistrate didn't dare collect taxes himself or enforce the law, interfere with the schools or maintain the roads. These and all other official responsibilities had been usurped by Bai. The provincial governor sorely wanted the commander-in-chief "decommissioned", one way or the other, but because Nei Xiang county was situated in a corner of Henan next to both Shaanxi and Hubei provinces, pursuit would merely end in futility and frustration when Bai and his men slipped across a border. How curious that in a time of foreign invasion and war for national survival that provincial border proprieties would still be maintained.Be that as it may, when all the counties but one had been assigned, I delivered a letter of resignation to Mr. Zhang and requested my personal posting to Nei Xiang."There's a reason why nobody is being sent there," explained my new superior as as I stood before him in his office.I conveyed deep regret that his office had no further need of me, and while I realized I would not make a significant difference in Nei Xiang, I still wanted to try. There would be litte risk in sending a single, unarmed boy in school uniform: hardly a threat to the local warlord. Bai Ting-fang would surely not retaliate with raids into Republican territory."Perhaps," said Mr. Zhang with an amused smile, "but mind you, if you get into trouble, there'll be no rescue. Keeping your head will be your own business."I answered that I fully understood the situation.He responded with a chuckle. "Good. And another thing. You'll go alone. I'm not willing to waste more than one life. In a sense you're lucky. There's no nonsense about the man; Bai doesn't believe in torture. If it comes to it, he'll make it quick and clean. A good, sharp blade." The danger meant absolutely nothing to me. A good, sharp blade. It almost sounded inviting. I humbly hanked Mr. Zhang and excused myself.Preparations for the journey required two days.  I entrusted my sword to a friend for safe keeping and left with only a sack of clothes and personal effects.The train took me as far as Nanyang county.  From there I walked the remaining distance to Nei Xiang county, a journey of three days. Once I entered Nei Xiang, a new feature in the landscape soon caught my eye. It was virtually unknown elsewhere in Henan, but to a boy from the mountains, the crop in the farmers' fields was all too familiar. Even without their red summer petals, I unmistakeably recognized the poppies of opium. My arrival at the magistrate's home was an occasion for consternation. "Why have you come?" asked the elderly gentleman, dressed in a leisure gown of light blue silk even though it was still mid-afternoon.I answered by asking if he had received advance notification of my assignment. "Yes, yes," he said impatiently as he led me into his office chamber, "but what are you after? What is your mission? Your real mission?"He offered me a chair, welcome relief given the skin rubbed raw on the back of both my heels, and I assured my host that my assignment was exactly as the official communication related.Stroking his long grey beard, he said, "Do you really expect to be allowed to train the Commander-in-chief's men? Why, you're just a boy." He shook his head disapprovingly. "Perhaps you should have given more thought to your own safety."I told the magistrate that I was simply following orders, and he told me, "Commander-in-chief Bai will never tolerate the presence in his stronghold of a republican officer, no matter how young and unobtrusive. If you value your life, you had better not climb old Bai's mountain!"Very obligingly, the magistrate offered to allow me to stay on in his home as a guest until the end of my term of assignment. So I settled in without any plans but to make the best of an awkward predicament. A little to my surprise, I found that the magistrate's excellent personal library provided some slight distraction.Every week, I was paid a visit by one of Commander-in-chief Bai's junior officers. These encounters were always congenial, in part perhaps because I harbored no resentment at being spied upon. One day appeared a Lieutenant Zhu, who seemed as young as a first-year university student. The lad, who spoke in a thick, uneducated brogue, was visibly uncomfortable in the presence of someone such as myself. That is to say a man not much older than himself but with a university education. Noticing the soiled white paper fan clutched in his hand, I asked, "Would you like me to try to do something with that? It could use a bit of color.""If you would like," said the soldier without the slightest inkling of "proper" protocol and the necessity of never accepting a kindness upon the first offer. I took his fan from him and brought it to my writing desk.  Using my wolf's hair brushes, I painted orchids on the one side of the fan and wrote a poem in Zhuan-style calligraphy on the other. That afternoon, Lieutenant Zhu left the estate rather pleased with his refurbished possession.A few days later, the boy returned with another blank fan. "Commander-in-chief Bai," he said timidly, "would like to see what can be done with this one."Within half an hour, I filled the fan's one side with a rustic scenetiny pavilion half-hidden in a grove of maples at the edge of water.  On the opposite side, I wrote a drinking poem about a warrior indulging himself with companions at their lakeside hideaway on the eve of battle.  Handing the finished piece back to the lieutenant, I said, "With my compliments," but wondered to myself whether the poetic sentiment was presupposing.  The answer came the very next morning in the form of an invitation to dinner at Bai's mountain stronghold.I dressed in fresh clothes and had a servant purchase for me several ceramic jars of the finest local spirits. Mid way through morning, Lieutenant Zhu came to fetch me, and together, a jar of liquor dangling from each of our hands, we made our way at a leisurely pace through the town and across the farm lands, into the woods and up a long, circuitous mountain path. By late afternoon, we seemed to reach the trail's end at a huge stone block. Circumnavigating this obstacle, Bai's liar came abruptly into view.Around a grassless clearing stood a veritable village of bamboo and wooden huts. Dozens of men and women were busy at their jobs as grooms, blacksmiths, cooks, etc.  To the east was a great corral with easily over a hundred stout mountain mules. Beyond this, a sparse forest of scrub and stunted trees.  To the west was a rocky cliff at the top of which stood soldiers on watch.  "This is one of our smaller camps," informed Lieutenant Zhu.  "The major ones are close by.""Why do you scatter your forces?"Finally in his element, the shrewd lieutenant smiled slyly and said, "It would get too crowded otherwise. Too smelly."I chuckled at his answer, realizing that he might be lying for tactical purposes. Or the claim that there were other encampments might be a strategic lie. If not, I understood without having to have it explained to me that the arrangement afforded Bai the distinct advantage of attacking an approaching enemy from two or more sides.  We followed a second trail to the rocky cliff and then walked along its base until the mountain yawned to reveal a cavernous opening. As we descended stone steps, I caught the smoky aroma of pig roasting over an open fire. I looked out over six long tables laden with great clay jugs of liquor, silver platters heaped with sliced meats and porcelain bowls steaming with cooked poultry, fish, mushrooms and vegetables.  Around the tables were seated a great host of hardy, high-spirited men. ***Some were laughing. Others were playing at drinking games. Great quantities of liquor were being consumed at a prodigious rate not to mention spilled over the tables and ground and over the imbibers themselves. Men reached their chopsticks into the platters and bowls, picking out choice pieces of meat, filling up their own bowls and picking up the overflow that fell onto the tables with their fingers. They ate like starved dogs, they ate so voraciously that it surprised me a little that fights did not break out over the food even despite the fact that there was plenty, more than plenty for all.One fellow was cattiwalling in a dialect I couldn't understand. Mere gibberish to my ears. But the men immediately around him seemed very pleased, guffawing at some bawdy lyrics no doubt. A few smacked their open palms against the table top in genuine appreciation and shouted, "Good! Good!"The so-called song came to an end, and the warbler extended his hands, took a large fish dish between his  grubby fingers and I thought rather gingerly rotated the plate completely around until the head of the fish faced a thickset man in his late forties or early fifties."Commander-in-Chief," said the man obsequiously, "It is now your turn.""My turn?" said the stout man. "Is that so? Well, this fish thing may be a tradition with your people, but I as a truly typical representative of my people can not sing. I don't know the words to anything.""You're a natural born poet," said the warbler. "Just make something up.""Just make something up, the man says." The suggestion seemed to strike the robust commander as funny, for a spurt of laughter escaped his lips, and he said, "Alright, alright. Anything to apease the people. Let's have a go at it."The man I presumed to be Bai Ting-fang stood up, and he shut his eyelids as the pupils behind them appeared to float up towards the top of his head. He started not really singing per say but rather moaning, or groaning, heming and hawing, all as his voice slid randomly up and down the musical scale, creating an effect that I could just barely tell was meant to mimick the convoluted, ground-creeper like progressions of opera. Eventually, however, an indistinct mumbling did seem to emerge from the noise, and eventually again, actually decipherable words started coming out of the commander's mouth:"The woman's breath is worse than a boar'sbut her body is soft and fat in all the right places.I'll stake a claim to this girl for a night,but if my wife is around, tell her I've gone into townto get some teeth pulled."Would not a man's wife notice if a man came home without any teeth missing?Lieutenant Zhu led me to a head of the table where Bai was seated. Stopping mid-lyric, for this had obviously been meant to be quite a long involved piece, the singer of opera look curiously up at us. He put down the pair of chop sticks he had been holding all this time and rose from his bench. His loose peasant shirt and trousers were far from military, making him virtually indistinguishable from his fellows. He smiled and said, "Scholar Zhou? Is it? Since Little Zhu would not have picked up just any stray, I assume that it must be." The man bowed his head and raised his arms, making a fist with his one hand and cupping it with his other hand. "A great, great, great privilege and honor."I too saluted using the same gesture to symbolize the melding of the scholar, the open hand, and the warrior, the fist. "The privilege and honor are without a doubt entirely mine." I slipped the rope handles of my liquor jars off my wrists and passed them to Commander-in-chief Bai.I was seated next to Bai, and bowls of spirits were passed around. The host made a toast to my health and well-being. I responded with a toast to his warmth and hospitality. We drank deeply and then turned our bowls upside down to boast their emptiness. As we set our vessels on the table again right-side up, serving maids refilled them to the brim."This potion," I remarked, "is as fragrant as Sichuan's Five Grain Liquor and every bit as hot going down.""Tasteless water," said Bai with a frown of disgust. He shook his head. "'Mountain tea brewed by a bunch of old hags."I corrected him, "'Mountain lightening!"Bai laughed and reached out with his chopsticks to a platter of succulent roast pork. He picked out a fat, juicy slice and placed it in my bowl. "The long walk must have worked up an appetite.""Even had I been delivered by sedan chair, how could I not be famished before the sight and smell of such a feast?!""He's got a tongue alright, doesn't he?" said my boisterous host to the officers to either side of the table. They agreed to a man, but any of them really disagree. "Taste it!"  Commander Bai cried to me. "Eat it while it's hot! What flavor it possesses will be completely lost once cool!"I took a bite from the slice and though it was still so hot that it singed my palette, I managed to hum with pleasure. "To think," I said, "that at such a distance from the capital I would find the true master of 'red fire meat'.  Superb! I've never tasted anything to compare."My host replenished my bowl with morsels of food, and one of his officers stood up to propose a toast: "A salute to our young guest's scholarship and the Commander-in-chief's shrewd eye for character!" We raised our wine bowls, put them to our lips and tossed back our heads.  Again, we showed our drained bowls before setting them down. And again, no sooner had we done so than they were topped back up."You must forgive me," said Bai, wiping his mouth with the back of his muscular, hairy forearm.  "When you first came to Nei Xiang, I had no idea that you were a man of letters." He started tapping the palm of his left hand with the back of his right hand. "But then when I saw the fan I said to myself, 'Nobody in this place could have done this! Not even the magistrate!' We're an uneducated lot, but we still appreciate the value of culture. Please believe me when I say that had I known I would have come to pay my respects in person."I shook my head, vigorously, and protested, "Nooo. Your time is far too valuable for trivial concerns!"He said, "I hear tell that you may have been sent to train my men. Imagine that! Naturally, I assumed you were a soldier.""Neither soldier nor scholar," I said. "Merely a student.""A student of war perhaps?" mused Commander-in-chief Bai with an amused chuckle, which he quickly suppressed. Plucking a peanut from the thick, dark sauce of a chicken platter, he popped it into his mouth and crunched away. "Outstanding!" The sauce or my presumed strategic acumen and expertise?A pistol handle bulged beneath Bai's shirt, and he ate using a double-edged dagger.  A few officers wore broadswords in leather sheaths slung over their backs, and more swords as well as rifles were piled onto a table at a small distance. Spears were leaned against a tree. Without acknowledging the compliment of my host, I looked him in the eyes and said, "You were right in that I was 'officially' sent to train your men, but what you may not be aware of is the true mission, which is to observe your methods."My host smiled shyly. "But what could you possibly learn from me? Why, I can't even read or write. The methods I employ are crude and simple.""Simple but effective."***Once again to a man, all of the officers nodded agreement, but Commander-in-chief Bai stroked his stubbly chin and warily said, "You flatter me.""Guizhou is my home province," I said, "where brigands are the blight of the land. You have rid your land of such locust, and the people are grateful. They prosper once again with no fear for their families.  They live with pride and dignity.  There is much to be learned here."Bai chuckled in a subdued, suspicious tone. For wasn't he, in fact, the brigande who ruled this area. He said, "The people pay us land duty, and in return, we help them out a bit. We protect them. That is all.""And the special crop selection insures that the land duty always reaps a nice hefty financial harvest."Commander-in-chief Bai's face suddenly assumed an open expression. He looked at me quizzically as all other conversation around our table rapidly died away. "Oh?" he said. "And what special crop selection is this?  The peasants grow what they want. They grow what the soil will bear."I cautioned the man, "I'm from Guizhou. I know poppy when I see it.  Even now in October  I would have known it better in July and August when the snow-white sap is harvested and blackened during long days under a watchful sun.  My guess is that yours is a blackness worth its weight in gold.""In Nei Xiang County," said Bai, the volume of his voice rising steadily, "opium smoking is a capital offense!" He jammed his dagger into the table with tremendous force, rattling every bowl and platter.  "Here we cure addicts with a stroke of the sword or ax!"Indeed. I glanced around to see that all tables had fallen silent. All eyes were trained either on Bai or myself. A sword or an ax. How did it feel the moment the blade violated the skin, or cut into the vertebrae or sliced through the windpipe, if one felt anything at all by that point. Had I taken the tease a step too far? I muttered softly, "Wise policy. Unambiguous policy. It safeguards the community against the scourge of drug addiction. You will surely agree that the government prohibition is sound policy too.""I needn't agree with anything!" boomed the Commander-in-chief. " Understand, student, that here your party government is meaningless! Meaningless! Here, I  am the law! I am life, and I am death!"A few strands of steam rose from the slices of meat on a platter. A stones throw away, a woman was busy hacking off the wide thigh of the pig on the spit. Two small boys tumbled into view, wrestling like wolf pups, but then a grandma urgently put a stop to their game and ushered them away.I calmly said, "Rest assured. This toothless pup is not about to hound anyone for the sake of upholding official policy.""Then why are you here?!" roared the Commander-in-chief, his eyes dark beads, the pupils fully dilated.I bowed my head low, just a little afraid to expose the back of my neck in case he was tempted right then and there to save his brigande court and executioner the trouble and take a meat cleaver to this overly-clever boy. I endeavored to maintain bladder control and explained, "As I said before, I am here to learn how to suppress bandits." I lifted my head, but kept my gaze down.  "First things first.  Protect the people, then worry about changing society.""I don't force my brother peasants to do anything," growled the ruffled host.Bai wasn't speaking nearly as loudly as before, and the edge to his voice seemed to have softened considerably. So I nodded, finally allowing myself to look up again. "You simply keep them informed of market opportunities, especially down the river at Wuhan."For some moments Commander-in-chief Bai studied me carefully. Then he propped his elbow on the table and covered his face with a broad hand. Peeking at me through between his fingers, he shook his head and began to laugh.  "You," he said, "know all about me, don't you?""I'm a student of the market, a student of the streets. I know what I see and nothing more."He took his hand from his face and leveled at me a wagging finger. "No one else dares to tell me what they know or think, but you, Little Brother, have a good solid backbone. And a keen eye to boot." My host rose from his seat and took up his wine bowl. Looking down at me with a gap-toothed grin he shouted, "To my new staff officer!"I sprang to my feet, knocking over the stool upon which I had been sitting."Nooo," I begged him. "Don't act in jest! Don't to act in haste!" I was getting a sight more than I'd bargained for! But old Bai motioned for me to shut up and resume my seat.He cried, "Nonsense! Accept your commission!  Accept it now!""Come come!" cried Lieutenant Zhu, and a great chorus arose: "Accept! Accept! Accept it now!"I seemed to have no other choice, that is if I cared for my neck, than to acknowledge, "An honor and a privilege.""Good!" shouted the Commander-in-chief, and he put the bowl to his lips and tossed back his head.  When he finished, he held the bowl out and turned it over. There fell not a drop."Drink!" cried one of the officers, and we all drained our bowls. The din of voices filled the air. Fresh dishes were brought out, and another round of sampling and toasting began. We ate, drank and caroused until dawn.  Through the haze of intoxication I watched the sun rise. I vomited profusely, but fortunately, no one of stature was conscious to witness this disgrace. As the sun began to climb, someone, perhaps Lieutenant Zhu, helped me from the table and put me to bed on a cot in one of the rough board huts.Thereafter, I became a regular observer in the mountain stronghold of Bai Ting-fang and did whatever was asked of me, mostly in the capacity of personal aide to the good commander. The fall turned to winter, which was bitter cold, so we whittled away long evenings with drink and conversation. I did the best I could to address my patron's questions regarding the outside world and to sketch for him an accurate picture of the great forces gathering all around. I said nothing more about opium, but I could tell that Bai was sowing ideas for legitimate crops against the inevitable day when Nei Xiang would be brought into the Nationalist fold.In May I tendered my 'resignation'. Although the iron-willed brigande king implored me to stay, he did nothing to keep me against my wishes. I begged his forgiveness, but I wanted to go back to school. I actually wanted again to learn from books. Something about this mountain sojourn had repaired the damage to my spirit, at least to the extent that I could function again. My patron accepted the whimsy of a young man who thought much too much, and he hosted a farewell banquet to dwarf the one of my initiation. When the day came, he and his men escorted me down the mountain to see me off. In parting, Bai told me to come back when I had had my fill with school; a special position on his staff would be waiting. He was even considering allegiance to the party.  I thanked him profusely, from the bottom of my heart, and promised to do his bidding and come back upon graduation.

7#JRVI=TWTWTWTWTWTeTTTUUU!U!UxTV% VEV*VTWVV[%VVV,VVVVVVChapter 2: April TeaOver two millennia ago the court scholar Zhang Chen embarked across the northern grasslands for the Far West of Asia, seeking allies for the Emperor against the Huns.  Although twice captured by the enemy, Zhang Chen never really surrendered. After thirteen years as a slave and fugitive in the wilderness "where the killing frosts come early", he completed his mission to royal acclaim.My own life seemed as still as a "painted ship on a painted ocean", but this rippleless existence in suburban America should have been as welcome as a breathless summer's day on the northern grassy sea. Zhang Chen had been on a royal mission. My present circumstances were the manifestation of a mundane destiny. Due to this insignificance, I had to continue holding myself captive. If I couldn't be of use to others, then the most useful thing I could hope to do was to keep from becoming a public menace.One day my disciplined monotony was disturbed.  I received a letter from Erinan invitation to lunch.  In the course of his odyssey, Zhang Chen had acquired a Hunish wife, who had undoubtedly helped him survive the wilderness. I would certainly receive no such blessing. Moreover, I recalled that as reward for his great triumph poor Zhang Chen had been sent back into the wilderness on another imperial errand, another trial of will and character and endurance. I myself was neither anxious nor prepared to go back out. With equal parts curiosity and dread, I accepted Erin's invitation.The middle of April brought mild weather, which is perhaps why Erin chose an outdoor bistro for the place of rendezvous. The time was half past ten in the morning, a bit too late for breakfest, too early for lunch, which meant that beside ourselves the place was deserted. We sat beneath an expansive wood frame veranda of sorts, supporting a grape trellis still leafless after winter. The tables had red checkered table clothes (how stereotypic) and thick, well-melted candles in glass holders. The silverware was unusually bright and gleaming, as if new and never before used.  From our seats, we looked out onto the sidewalk and road, but the scant pedestrian life of the street offered little competition for Erin's beauty, as though in my eyes such were possible in any case."How's your father?" she asked."Fine," I answered. "And your mother?""Fine."She smiled, and I smiled. The months' long separation had made formality sadly comfortable between we two. I picked up a glossy menu to examine its contents. The selection was ample and pricey."How's work going?" she asked."Maybe a bit better than before," I said without looking up."You're still writing curricula?""These days," I said, folding shut the menu, "my work has more to do with egg rolls than high school learning packets." I flipped the menu over to look at the back. "I quit Stanford.""Quit?"A young woman in brown suede jacket sheepishly apologized to me while endeavoring to squeeze through the very limited space between my seat and the closest seat of an adjacent table. Lurching forward in my metal chair to afford her wider passage, I told Erin, "Technically, I quit. But my boss was about fire me anyways. She gave me the option of falling on my own pen so to speak. That is, she let me submit a letter of resignation."  "I see," said Erin looking self-consciously up at the young woman, who decided against sitting too close to the only other human presences under the grape trellis and quickly moved on towards a far table.  I realized the mistake of my candidness and, to try to reballast the situation, offered, "I guess I did do some decent work for her. Wrote a few packets that got rave reviews and all."Erin visibly perked up. "That's good," she said. "Quotes from those reviews will look impressive in your portfolio.""Official authorship," I said, "belongs to the boss alone."Erin did not comment further. I was having a hard time maintaining a steady grip on my end of the conversation. Having a hard time not letting it tilt too much one way or the other. I tossed the menu aside. I said, "These days I work in a restaurant.""Oh?""Not quite like this one though." I chuckled. "Lunch counter. Bagelwiches and egg rolls. An eclectic menu.""Uh huh."There was a long pause; she was struggling to find something appropriate to say, something in no way interpretable as patronizing."There's an interesting-looking eggplant dish in this menu," I remarked. "Want to try it?""Yes," she said with a tepid smile, fingering the corner of her copy of menu, brushing a thumb over its stiff plasticized edge. "A possibility."I felt oddly compelled to tell her about the other day at work when a door knob had come off in my hand.  There I was, trapped in a filthy bathroom at the rear of a greasey kitchen. Body half-cocked, face pressed urgently to the door and lips puckered the better for funnelling cries of help through the lock bore. Maybe I wanted to see her smile, maybe I wanted to hear her laugh, but this time I refrained and, instead, played it safe: "Juggling four orders at a time is a real challenge. A little like a game. And I get to talk to co-workers and customers. It's actually kind of fun. Makes for a good night's sleep."Erin nodded. "Quite important that. A good night's sleep. How's the house?""Okay too. Jon and I ...  Jon's the guy who lives on the other side of the partition in my room?  The house painter cum artist?""I remember.""Jon and I seem to have pretty good rapport. Sometimes we dental floss together in front of the long mirror in the bathroom."Erin smiled. In genuine delight. What a splendid sight. I felt uplifted. Gratified. Like when a strong drink first goes to one's head. So much so, in fact, that I had to tell myself, "Down, boy, down." Near-recluses are so easily destablized and up-ended. Erin asked, "How's Anka?""Okay, I guess. " Truth was I only ever seemed to catch glimpses of the womanwalking across the hallway, leaving the kitchen just as I entered. She looked haggard wasted. Like the banshee of a person who had died from a terrible disease or malnutrition. I wondered how much longer Anka could hang on like this."How's Chris? In Pasadena?""Oh, Chris. Pasadena. Right you are. Thanks for asking. Ohhh.... My buddy's eating again and getting some sleep. He's stopped worrying about not being able to talk, so his stammer has begun to fade. And it doesn't seem to bother him that much anymore that he sees the top of his nose when he reads. The temptation to cut it off has apparently diminished to a safe level."Trying to stifle a giggle, Erin said, "Pardon me, but we are, afterall, birds of a feather. Kindred spirits. I'm glad he's managed to put things in perspective.""It's medication," I said."Oh," she replied.The waiter came with the tea Erin had ordered before my arrival. He poured steaming water into our cups and set the stainless steel teapot on the table. Extracting a small tablet from his apron pocket, he prepared to scribble our lunch orders. But, true to form, we told him we weren't quite ready yet, and he retreated with a smile. Picking up my cup, I swirled the water to bleed the tea bag. I watched the water begin to assume the color of caramel.  I had no real intention of drinking it though; I hated tea. Some Chinese, huh? And I really should have shut up at that point, especially considering how upbeat Erin seemed to be feeling, but as before, something within seemed to be trying to push its way out. This time I gave in: "Interviewed with this hydrologic research group not long ago. They made me an offer. To do computer modeling""Computer modeling?!" said Erin brightly."I don't know. Maybe I was a little afraid I couldn't do it. I told them yes, and then I told them maybe. When I waited a few more days to say yes again, they gave the job to somebody else.""Well ... maybe that wasn't quite the right position for you."Setting my cup down, I sloshed a bit of scalding tea onto my fingers, which I waved frantically in the air like an idiot. "So what if it wasn't what I wanted?  I need the job, don't I?" I stuck my fingers into my mouth, down to the second joints, and then immediately pulled the sopping fingers out again. "That's what I hate  about me?" Combing my hair to one side, I clawed into the scalp and shook my head, more violently than I'd intended. Like a wet dog trying to toss off the moisture. Sighing, I lowered a hand, finally limp and mastered. "But maybe I'm better off the way I am." I heard myself tap the pavement with my shoe and immediately put a stop to that too. "Even if I don't know what's best for me, at least now I know my tendencies." I took a deep breath. "My tendencies. Next time I will be able keep myself ... from doing the stupid thing." I nodded, again more vigorously than intended, than what most people would consider normal.  "Yes, I think so....  And something ...  appropriate ... is bound to turn up.... Just a matter of time." "I'm sorry," said Erin."Don't be. It's not your fault." I smoothed out my hair and breathed deep again. It's not , I repeated in my mind. It's not."To win," offered Erin feebly, "you've got to gamble."Ignoring the platitude, I said, "So what's up with you?"She gave me a little smile. "Just struggling through the long process of making myself functional here. Professionally and otherwise.""Have you taken a bridging exam yet? Is that what you have to do? Or is it the regular state bar exam?""There is a bridging protocol," she said. "And in another month or two I'll be able to take the state bar.""So you're staying."Erin picked up her teacup, but then lowered it without touching the cool porcelain rim to her lips. "David," she said. "There is something.""Something with your work?" I asked. "Something with money?" Why the hell did I ask a dumb question like that? The girl was loaded, and even if not, even if she had recently be swindled by another lunatic, was I prepared to consider, prepared to even listen to another plea for help?Erin smiled and looked down. She pinched the slim handle of her tea cup and rotated the cup in its saucer. "I want you to understand something, David. Something about me."I looked towards the street. An old woman wearing a thick brown sweater and lumpy grey beret strolled along at a respectable clip for someone her age. A sight one might expect to see in a French peasant village it struck me. Or the Basque region of Spain.Erin asked, "Do you know much about Queen Elizabeth?"I studied the grape trellis above, wondering why the leaves had yet to bud. I glanced across at the woman in the suede jacket; the way she kept looking furtively about made me think she was waiting for somebody who hadn't shown. The young male waiter was standing by the entrance to the dark restuarant interior, with his hands behind his back, looking bored perhaps, or focused on thoughts of some other place and some other time.  Feigning an air of detachment, I said, "Which Queen Elizabeth. The modern one or the one of old?"Erin smiled. "I'm glad that you make distinctions. I refer to the one of yore.""Oh, yore. Yes, of course. I know about her. A monumental reign. Glory and the destruction of her enemies.""Perhaps," said Erin with a wry chuckle. "And was she ever married?""No," I answered. "But she had had her share of lovers.""Yes, t-that's true too," stuttered Erin quickly, tentatively. "But they were lovers of a kind. I mean, the woman died a virgin.""So she would have us believe.""I believe it. Don't you ?"The waiter seemed suddenly to reappear beside our table with tablet in hand and pencil poised. I apologized for our neglect and promised we would soon be ready. Once more he left us alone, and I picked up the menu, trying to concentrate on making a selection, trying to block out the sight of the troubled person across the table from me."You have to understand," said Erin cautiously, taking up her menu too. "Elizabeth's mother gave birth and then lost her head. Quite literally.  Elizabeth's father saw to that.""I know," I said. "I remember this Glenda Jackson TV mini series from when I was a kid. I remember the executioner and the ax and the chopping block. Now about that eggplant dish?""Yes, you know," said Erin, trading her menu for a spoon, which she stressed between her fingers until it bowed, forming a "C". "Glenda Jackson and all that. But you don't really know. You can't. Elizabeth's birth and her mother's death. There's a straight shaft connecting the two, almost material, like an iron rod, only nobody could see it, except for poor Elizabeth. She could feel it."Erin paused to gauge my reaction, but I kept my face buried in the menu."That invisible shaft," continued Erin softly, putting the bent spoon back down on the table, "went right through Elizabeth""And pinned her to her life," I finished for her. I put down the menu but could not bring myself to look up at my lunch companion."Exactly!" she cried in triumph. I wanted to close my eyes, to blot her even from my peripheral vision. "I too," she said, "am held in my place.  Impaled by a spear, immaterial but real." I caught in my sights her self-conscious smile. She chuckled, adjusting the angle of the damaged spoon relative to her knife and fork. "Like a little bug in a bug collection." The smile persisted, thin and taut. I dared not look at the eyes. Those beautiful eyes. What emotion did they register? Gratitude? Torment? Triumph? Hopelessness? "Father left Mother at my birth, and Mother raised me alone. To me love is woman; abandonment is man."I chuckled and, seemingly unable to resist a chance for a little dig, said, "Then why aren't you back in jolly old Christchurch with dear old mum?" Finally raising my head, I saw in those large brown eyes, usually pillow -easy and a bit sleepy, the steely determination of a woman at great odds with herself but refusing to surrender, regardless of cost. I said, "Sorry." "My life," she said, "is a war. Someday I'm going back, but not until I've won."I raised my cup to the clich and toasted her, "To the destruction of your enemies.""You have to understand," she pleaded, pressing forward against the table's hard edge, causing it to inch towards me with a scraping sound against the pavement. "Maybe I love you or maybe I only care about you. But I care about you very deeply, and I know I could never marry you. I could never have your children. I want a husband I won't care about. Somebody I couldn't possibly come to love. I want a man who has no time for his wife, a man who needs one only as an asset, an ornament.  A husband I could be beautiful and charming for in his circle of business and society but nothing more.  You see, I need a man I won't have to worry about hurting when the time comes to leave him ... with our children....  Leave him before he leaves me. I know it's obvious, but still I can't deny it. You see, I am a pillager. For me, it's the only truth. Can't you see?"I found myself staring at her. The way she had said "our children" made me almost think that it referred to the children we, the two of us, were meant to have but never would. The children that should have belonged to me together with her but would now someday belong to a man other than me and therefore, ultimately, to Erin alone. I nodded yes although I meant no. How could I understand? I thought she was possibly a little mad. "Abandonment," I said softly, almost as if reciting a political jingo committed to memory and heart, "is man."She smiled.I added, "But is woman really love?"She narrowed her eyes and looked at me evilly. In the next moment, her eyes were wide again, and I caught the glistening of tears, welled from deep springs of torment. With childlike simplicity she asked, "Am I a ratbag?"She was no different from me.  Her soul yearned to fly free, to range far and wide, like a lark in the sky, but power derives from purpose in endeavor. Ours is an impersonal age when every life is a world onto itself, cut off from other lives and collapsed under the weight of autonomy and privacy."Not at all," I answered."Really?" she begged. "Really?"Erin's war was desperate; mine merely humiliating.  I so wished to help her fight her battles and bear the pain, yet at the same time I was thankful that I would not. At that instant there crystallized in my heart something I certainly already understood in my mind: more important than courage, strategy and even perseverance is country, which is what you fight for.  You have to know exactly where the homeland lies, see it in your heart. My country is my parents, just as Erin had claimed. They alone of all the people of the world speak the same language as me and share a common heritage. Their lives are my history. In a sense, my life and my father's is a single life spanning two generations, two eras, two lands. I wasn't really sure how much I valued my citizenship, whether I would have fought for this peculiar country had I had the choice, but I could no more revoke my personal nationality than I could my physical center of gravity. The attempt to do so would end in free fall, as it had already done.  I cleared my throat. I said, "I recently read in a children's book, of all places, that the Vikings delighted in torturing their captives before putting them out of their misery. Things like pulling their lungs out through slits cut between the ribs."Erin smiled awkwardly and chuckled. She said with a quaver, "What gruesome entertainment. What brought that on? You are kidding, aren't you?""No," I said, shaking my head. "I'm not. They even had a name for it: the 'blood eagle'."She looked at me, mouth moving, as though to say, "oh really?" Then she knit her brows, pressed her lips together and cast down her eyes.Just minutes earlier I would have assumed that Erin was firmly grounded in a Viking family-nation, but now the immaculate young siren across the table appeared to me countryless, homeless. Without gravity, without sky."That isn't you," I told her with utter confidence. "You're no Viking. You're civilized and decent. Vulnerable and tender-hearted and extremely, extremely kind. You took care of me, remember? When I was sick. You helped me when I was poor."You are a marauder to no one but yourself.A look of relief suffused Erin's lovely face, but only for the moment. She lowered her eyes again and said, "Thank you all the same. Your saying so means the world to me." She picked up her spoon and set to bending it back into shape.It was no wonder that neither us had any appetite whatsoever.Two Skies     v Fg gvJg.Jg* LE"JpN>fRp.2<gBG`@~`<UJgprU_pJfp.2<gBG`~0LN^NuNVH~Y?.N(_ g Tp hr2p WDLN^NuNVH<.B0S@gS@gU@g`>~`:|v/p/NX&Jf/p/NX&JfvfH/NXOLN^NuNVH,...o ` LN^NuNV/UN~>f0`0..N^NuNVH&n(n0.U@f4 gC@ I"Lr:6RAH . gC y}!z!#Y#]$v${$$$$'W'Y(b(h)+)-.`.a.t.w1122448 8#8P8S99;;==@@BJBNFFGGJ=JLJMJNJQJRJW@P@8CL/mIREeDKG5qUr8 8$[$$$$$$$$$$$$6$[$t$%*%d%&U&&'f()0*1*h,|,-:--.=.^.{/0182334404y456&688V8<>,>9>_?>@j@@CzDEF0FGGHIIJ;J<J=$$$$$$$$:J=JNJOJPJQJR$,$Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@IRJR5$*+3y;CIRmP:mV @JW&$[J=JR'()U/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH(FG(HH(d'h=/BH-: HP DeskJetNew YorkTimesCourierI9I9I9O)HO)H,Desktop PublishingDesktop Publishing

7#CmPBXN\N\N\N\N\NjNNNOOO,O,OxNP0 PPP*PN\PPf%PPP6PPPPPPChapter 3: Road Trip"What do you mean we have to reload the car?" shouted my sister."Look," I said, "if you want to get this futon of yours in, then some things have to be rearranged.""I spent over two hours loading up last night.""I'm sorry," I told her, "but you forgot to leave space for the futon! If you can think of a way to get it in without rearranging, I'd be more than happy to try.""Fuck," she cried, yanking a pair of styrofoam swimming floats off the top of the pile in the back seat. "Why'd you have to borrow the futon from me in the first place?! Why couldn't you have just slept on the floor?!" She pitched the floats onto the driveway, and they skipped halfway to my share house steps.Jennifer had quit her job at the end of April in order to finish nursing school at our home town university. I'd gotten substitutes for me at the restaurant so that I could take time off to help her drive cross country. After nearly an hour, everything was back in the car, and we were ready to roll.Once on the expressway, Jennifer turned on the radio and tuned into a country-western station."What's this?" I asked."What do you think?" she answered as she flipped on the left turn signal and we shifted into the adjacent lane. "You've got to be kidding?" I said, changing stations. "You don't really listen to that stuff." "Yes," she said, changing back. "I do.""It's five days till we get home! I didn't take off work to put up with this stuff for five days!""Well what do you like to listen to?""New wave.""I hate that stuff!""Well, you can't have everything your way, you know! Just because it's your car doesn't mean you can dictate terms! Maybe you can listen to country-western for awhile and then I can listen to new wave for awhile, but you can't listen to country-western forever! I mean, you've got to be fair!""Alright already," said Jennifer, and to my total dismay, she switched back to my station.I looked out the window at the heavy traffic in the third and fourth lanes, at the highway signs and billboards, at the industrial parks and strip malls. "What a wasteland," I observed. Jennifer made no reply; she liked urban California.  The sound of the wind and traffic practically drowned out the radio, so I turned up the volume.At one o'clock we stopped at a McDonalds for lunch.  I suggested that we keep driving to make up for lost time, but Jennifer wanted to actually sit down at a table to eat. Nevertheless, I didn't put up a fuss."So," I said, a McChicken sandwich poised before my mouth, "I guess it's your turn after lunch.""My turn for what?" asked Jennifer, salting her fries."The radio," I said. "And aren't those fries salty enough to begin with?"She thumped the shaker down onto the table."So when did you start listening to country-western?" I asked."I don't know," she said and bit a fry in half. Bit it with real conviction as though it were her little brother's irritating head."I guess you really like it, huh?""So?" "Nothing," I said. "I wasn't trying to be critical.""Yeah, right. Like country-western isn't very Chinese."Chewing my McChicken, I mumbled, "Neither is this sandwich."We reached Lake Tahoe shortly after the sun slipped behind the dark summits of the Sierras, but there was still plenty of driving time since neither of us felt particularly tired. It was my turn behind the wheel; Jennifer navigated. As we cruised through the quiet streets of the small resort town, I asked, "How come you decided to go back to Pennsylvania?"She didn't answer.We might have passed by a public park or something because I could have sworn to the pungent smell of fresh-mown grass, which conjured the strong illusion that we were already in Pennsylvania. As the olfactory illusion quickly faded, I resumed, "You've only got a few more semesters of nursing school left. You don't have to go home to finish your degree. I mean, I know how much you like living in California and all.""So do you think Dad will be like  ...  the way he used to be?" She agitatedly reached down below her seat to pull its position lever and slide it back away from the dash. The seat met the end of the seat rails with a minor bang. "I mean, he'd better not be bossy.""He seemed different" I said, "during those last few months I was at home.""All I can say is he'd better not try to tell me things. He's so negative, always down on things. Never leaving me alone." Jennifer wrapped her arms around herself and began to rock back and forth, like a metronome needle, like her father, in fact, the metronome-needle story teller. "Just because I'm American he thinks he's got to try to change me! Well, what's so special about being 'Chinese'?!." Like a character out of the Bible, she gnashed her teeth; I could actually hear the grinding sound. She grunted to herself. She nodded, emphatically, twice. "You know, you're just like him too.  You guys act like royalty.  Geeez! You're both fucking principalities""You mean 'princes', don't you?""Sooo critical of everything! You think you're really smart. You think you're special! Well, the two of you better not try to make decisions for me. I hate that, you know! I hate it! Just you try and see what happens!""So why don't we stop the car," I suggested, "and pound on me for a while just like you did on Dad a few years back. How old was he then? Seventy-five? Rapping on his back with both fists while he was washing dishes? What was that all about anyways? You were screaming at him at the top of your lungs for something." I shrugged my shoulders. "Simply laughed at you, didn't he?"Shaking her head, Jennifer hissed, "A regular little mini Dad." "You 're the one who's just like him. Not me. Huh-uh. Ever since we were kids. The way you think. The way you act. The laughing! A favorite tactic; must be in the genes. Used to drive Mom crazy. Dad did it, and you did it too. Not listening to what she was saying, making her madder and madder; then came the snicker! I can hear it now. Salt smeared into an open wound."Looking over at my sister, I saw her hunched forward, eyes riveted to the dash. We had already left the town behind, so there were no more street lamps. Neither was there a moon. All I could see was her dark silhouette, shivering with rage.She was sacrificing her cherished California lifestyle to take care of the man who had always tyrannized her. I knew why too. And so did she.  It was simple. He was her father, and he needed someone. I was starting to see that my sister was indeed descended from soldiers. Going back suddenly seemed an awfully Chinese thing to do. The next morning Jennifer took what seemed like hours getting ready for the road. After checking out of the motel, she insisted on breakfast at a sit-down restaurant. Because I tend to feel drowsy and out of sorts after eating too much early on, I ordered toast and juice. When I finished first, I had nothing to do but to sit and fume while my sister nibbled at her bagel sandwich and took her coffee in birdlike sips.When, after over a full-hour breakfest, we were finally on our way, I held up a cassette tape and said, "You want to try something new?" It was my turn with the entertainment. She was behind the wheel."What do you mean?" Jennifer snatched the tape from my hand. "It's got Chinese writing all over it. What is it? Is it Dad's story?""Well, yes," I confessed. "Oh, Guang!" she boomed. "You recorded this for God's sake! You've probably listened to it a hundred times already!" A tractor trailer also traveling east roared by, the current of its wake rocking the Datsun and shoving us towards the side of the road. The gigantic truck swerved into our lane and barreled ahead, leaving us to follow through its cloud of dust."No," I protested in as calm a voice as I could simulate, searching the dash controls for an air recycle option to block the dust. But what options could one expect to find in a cheap Datsun honeybee? "I mean, I recorded it, but that's not exactly the same thing as listening to it. You don't start hearing  what's there until the second or third time. Besides, don't you listen to music tapes more than once?"Jennifer rolled her window down part way, but this only served to let more dust in. Jennifer coughed. She said, "No," in a tone flat and hoarse but conveying a surprising measure of authority."You listen to music tapes only once?" "No," said Jennifer, "means 'no, you may not play that tape'." She tossed it onto the far left-hand side of the dash, seemingly beyond my reach. You hypocritical, narrow-minded, cowardly little bitch, I cursed in my mind but prudently, meekly refrained from verbalizing.  "The rule of the car," I said, "is that whoever's turn it is with the radio gets to choose what we listen to.""No," she reiterated."You agreed to it!" I sang. "That's like an oral contract!  It's binding!""Oh Guang, don't be stupid. Besides, the agreement is for radio. It doesn't include cassettes."It was a bright blue unrelentingly sunny Neveda day. The sparsely vegetated desert surface compounded the glare from on high. Far off in the distance, condors circled in the air, probably above a fatally ill or injured animal, imminent road kill perhaps or an antelope with a broken leg."You played a Jamie Lou Harrison tape last night," I observed with a smile.Jennifer coughed. "Guang, that's not even like her name. And you've got to admit, she isn't very country-and-western. More like folk or folk rock.""Her style," I said, "is immaterial. You played a tape, so now I get to play a tape."Jennifer laughed. "No, no, nooo.""In that case, stop the car.""Oh Guang""Stop the car!" I shouted. "NOWWW!"The car came very quickly to a halt, but surprisingly without a screech. Jennifer admonished, "Don't be ridiculous." I unbuckled my seat belt. "Guua-ang," she warned through clenched teeth. I opened the door. "I'm going to pull away," she said. "You're just going to get knocked down when you try to get out. I'm not kidding.  The car's already in gear. Don't blame me if you lose some teeth." With tortoise-like deliberation, almost in slow motion, almost as if in a separate dimension and reality, one in which time was dilated relative to ours and atomic motion itself occurred with excruciating sluggishness, I removed myself from the car.  "Fine," she said with a casual shrug, but then she couldn't contain herself any longer and screamed, "SHIT!" The front tires squealed. The car sped off.The car disappeared beyond the crest of a small rise.I stood in the middle of the highway. There seemed no sign of motion anywhere save for the movement of my chest as I breathed in and out, and a light wind whistling in my ears. I couldn't help myself grinning. Though I was alone in my basement half-cell for hours and days on end, this was a different type of solitude. Here was the heat of the sun on my body, on my face. Here was the brush of that wind over my skin, its push fluctuating in force and direction upon my chest and limbs, ruffling my light teeshirt and baggy shorts. This was a solitude without sensory deprivation. This was a solitude in which I was a part, a seemingly integral part of the physical world.With my eyes I saw again in the distance the high circling buzzards. With my mind I saw far beneath them the antelope or mule deer slumped on the hot dusty ground, its legs folded beneath its chest and belly. The animal was too parched and roasted to feel anymore the pain of the bone, snapped in two, the result of one bad leap over terribly uneven terrain. Fast coming death would be the final mercy.I started to walk, the condors off to the southeast. The sensation of solid asphalt beneath my feet felt good after floating for so long in the cramped car. The flexing of my muscles again, even if but minimally, the blood flowing through my veins and warming my body, the swinging of my arms, all very refreshing, all very welcome. I shut my eyes and saw against that illuminated red curtain of my eyelids the giant red star spinning at a thousand miles a second but with the illusion of slowness, of torpidity born of its galactic size. The multitude of specks of light flew around their unsurpassable master at tens of thousands of miles per second in a cloud of orbits. Yet never a collision.I rotated a hundred and eighty on my own axis and looked away, in the direction of Old Blue, with but thirty-five pinpoints of dazzling light held by its gravity. So cool a blue. Soothing to the eyes. Tender to the senses. A star whose light neither burned nor blinded. Whose radiation penetrated the skin in a most unusually pleasant way. Maybe like for a swimmer in the ocean, and the ocean permeating the swimmer. Swimmer and sea blending a little together. A perfectly compatible mixture. The swimmer becoming liquid. Liquid in liquid. Light in light. What could bring more joy?I opened my eyes again, to the highway and the white painted divider strips and the ripples of orange sand spreading out from the side of the road to a seemingly featureless desert plain to a horizon so remote that the sight of it was grainy and indistinct, as though the world at that distance was in the process of molecular disintegration. The nearer buttes were slanted, tilted, with strata of orange and maroon. The distant relief offered no details of stratification, no details whatsoever, but only unbroken forms in purple, the superposing of the orange of the land and the blue of the sky. The great sky. Oh, how she blanketed the world, yet rose and rose, up and up, as perfect and flawless a blue as any god and creator could have conjured through imagination and will. Time passed, and I walked westward, ever westward.Time passed, and I exulted.Time passed.Time passed.An hour and a half later, I heard the hum of Jennifer's Datsun honeybee approaching from the east. She slowed to a stop and opened the door. I looked at my sister, but she was looking straight ahead. I felt disappointed. I had been too short a time on my own. I didn't want to get back into that car. I looked inside. My tape was still sitting on the dash.  A plastic soda cup with a lid and straw was wedged between the driver's seat and emergency brake lever. After a few more awkward seconds, I resigned myself and got in.Jennifer made a U-turn, and we headed eastward again."Here," she said tossing me a brown paper bag that had been sitting on the car floor beneath her legs. I opened it to find a can of diet Coke and a bag of potato chips."Diet Coke," I said. "Is this what you're  drinking these days?""Have you looked in a mirror lately?" she asked.  "You could stand to lose a couple.""Oh yeah?" I returned. "In that case, what's with the potato chips? That really makes a lot of sense." I twisted the top of the bag shut again and dropped it onto the floor. "I ain't hungry.""Suit yourself," said Jennifer. "We're going to end up losing three hours,""And who's to blame for that?" "Alright already. Geeez. So next time I'll get you pretzels or something."For the rest of what was left of the morning, we rode in silence, and I gazed out the window to follow the sagebrush in their perpetual westward retreat.In the afternoon, I was behind the wheel. As Jennifer awoke from a protracted after-lunch nap, I eyed the tape on the dash."Ate the potato chips," I informed her, but she made no reply. "Also drank the diet Coke." She turned her head to look out the window. "You remember those walks we used to take with Dad back in Utica?" I said. "It was always in the evenings after dinner, and Dad would tell us those scary stories?" I turned to Jennifer but only saw the back of her head.  "We used to think he made them up. He had a different story every night. There were fox fairies and ghost-busting monks and vampires who took the form of beautiful women to suck the blood out of you through tiny holes bored into the soles of your feet?""He didn't 'make up' those stories," countered Jennifer testily."I know," I said. "They were mostly from 'Liaozhai'.""They were from Chinese novels.""That's what 'Liaozhai' is," I explained. "The title of a book.""Sooo?""So you remember how those stories used to scare us?  How we really liked them?" I pursed my lips as I looked at the tape on the dashboard again. I said, "Dad was a really good story teller." I leaned forward to see if I could catch a glimpse of her reaction from the limited view I had of her profile. I couldn't. I said, "He's still a good story teller." Very carefully, and with bated breath, I reached for the tape and drew it towards me. Jennifer didn't make a move. Slowly, very slowly and carefully, I brought the tape down to the cassette player and inserted it. Jennifer yawned and rubbed her eyes. ....I turned on the player and adjusted its volume.Two Skies     vf$$H P#H00Cl1@ BX .CnpLJ@Nu@F&C!Q<"FNu@F&H`C U$@ U @f"<`g"J )<U$@f#j<<LFNuNdk/5PSrt#*!"BCKO}inOTdjknRUVZmq"6>u|    ""######$,$1&{&~&&@]&&'''''**:9:=:[:b<<<<@@CWCXCgChCiCkClCmCr@P@^azNw%L/g?}~Pv!!$$$$$$$$$B!!!""###$R%s%&U&&&&' ''''()**<*O***-+.01{3677#717?7@7A7789V9:7:y:;;;<K<<<=e?@@A@c@@AADAtABBuBBC $$$$$$$$FC C&CWCXCiCjCkClCm,$Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@$$BmCmz")<197@tBmrLHB}&Cr"#!!C Cm$%&U/Ki#  C E  !!""$*$6$B%%%%%/-/67799:D:e::?HH@Rd(hh@d'=/BH-: HP DeskJetNew YorkTimesCourier6@6@6@T3sB6temp 33+1Desktop PublishingDesktop Publishing

7#3<2:W:W:W:W:W:ef:::::::;}x:; <<[*<:W<[<+0<[<[<<[<[<[<[<[<[Chapter 4: Finding a Wife and JobFor the time being, the Japanese did not invade inland from Shanghai, and I returned to Nanjing for my final year at university. One day during a visit with a cousin of mine who happened to live in Nanjing, his wife brought up the subject of marriage. It so happened that she was related to a young woman in need of a suitable match. As soon she uttered the name, I immediately conjured an image of beauty and grace since I had once actually met the unforgettable girl."Never mind your father's poverty," said my cousin with a sympathetic smile. "We all have a deep and abiding respect for you as an individual."When my cousin volunteered to act as go-between in marriage negotiations, I thanked him for his kindness and promised to think the matter through. At the same time, I shuddered at the allusion to my family's penury, deciding me right then and there to spurn the alluring offer.Chen Guo-fu, the emaciated executive director of our university, he of the hacking cough and silver phlegm box, was appointed by Chiang Kai-shek as the governor of Jiangsu province, and in this new, grander capacity, he wasted little time in setting an agenda for reform and reconstruction.  First, all households would be registered, an undertaking to help flush out brigands and black marketeers. Second, the provincial accounts would be audited on a yearly basis, which would facilitate elimination of the redundant taxes heaped on peasants by greedy local officials.  Third and foremost, a canal would be dug from Hongze Lake in central Jiangsu to the ocean. The Yellow River to the north was already connected to Hongze Lake by the Grand Canal, so this new channel would create a conduit to the sea for that mighty river's periodic overflows, which at the time still flooded great areas of heavily inhabited land and claimed victims by the tens and hundreds of thousands. Moreover, the canal would likely create vast new wealth by making possible the regional expansion of agriculture and commerce. Governor Chen would become the modern Li Bing, who in antiquity had tamed the raging waters of the Min River to make Sichuan a rich and powerful kingdom onto itself. Perhaps old Chen could already hear the echo of his family name over the coming millennia. In any case, I graduated at the end of the academic year with a degree in finance. A couple of weeks later, I reported to the headquarters of Jiangsu province's Farmer's Cooperative Bank and was assigned to Baoyin County to organize its local branch office as a minute part of Governor Chen's ambitious agenda.Although our bank was "cooperative" by charter, no peasants actually participated in setting policies, administrating operations or even carrying out day-to-day functions, such as tellering or sweeping the floors. In fact, bank officers disdained associating with peasants altogether; they absolutely shunned venturing out into the countryside.  Not surprisingly, therefore, they had little desire to extend loans to peasants.  So while bank revenues derived mainly from peasant taxes, loans went exclusively to landlords and merchants at the deeply discounted rate of around five percent. The landlords and merchants, in turn, loaned money to needy peasants at around twenty percent or more.One day I received a telegraph from Zhang Yuan-yang, an earlier graduate of the political academy. The telegraph bore a simple message: "Come to Funing", the county over which he now presided as magistrate. When I did as requested, I was offered a job as chief financial officer with a free hand to deal with Funing's own uniquely corrupted finance system. Happily, I abandoned my post of futility at Baoyin and joined Zhang's executive staff at Funing.Under its last magistrate, Funing's lands office had been broken into and robbed by bandits. In the midst of this chaos someone had had the wherewithal to make off with several wooden chests full of land duty records and then sell them piecemeal to ninety-seven families. Owing to its monopoly on data, the loose confederation of these ninety-seven families became the county's de facto collection agency for peasant land taxes, and needless to say, they kept the lion's share of revenues, surrendering but a trifling amount to the authorities.  Hence, it became my primary mission to see to it that state coffers began again to fill back up.In retrospect, I suppose I could have squeezed the desired sum from the ninety-seven families, but of course, the families would simply have shifted their financial burden onto the peasants through still higher levies. So concerned with the common folk was I (since I was cut from similar cloth), I chose the far tougher proposition of reclaiming the source of their powerthe lost land duty records.Well before a plan of action could be devised let alone put into action the tax confederation got wind of my intentions and made a number of overtures.  Their bribes took various forms, including, I might add, some very comely and charming young "potential brides", but I stiffly rebuffed every one.  Subsequently, coordinated police raids on the homes of the ninety-seven produced absolutely nothing except for perhaps the savvy to engage informants of my own for future endeavors rather than rely on the old, established, undoubtedly corrupted ones.  I immediately undertook thorough and exhaustive investigations, and before many days a figure emerged from the shadows, a figure with the power to foil us at every turn. My nemesis was none other than the magistrate's own brother, a shiftless character known for extravagent appetites and the ability to spend to the very last penny any sum of money, no matter how great, that came into his hands. Bit by bit, with the caution of a physician preparing a patient for the breaking of bad news, I disclosed my findings to Magistrate Zhang, never making direct accusations but, rather, allowing the facts to speak for themselves and lead him to the only possible conclusion. Magistrate Zhang, however, chose to ignore the mounting evidence and not arrive at the only possible conclusion.  Resultantly, the tax records remained out of our reach, and at the end of the first fiscal month of my appointment, loans from outside creditors were needed in order to meet the budget. After this disgrace, I confronted the magistrate with eye witnesses to his brother's complicity, but again, he remained adamantly passive.  At the end of the second month, the treasury borrowed heavily once more. By the end of the third month, I was under attack for incompetence and corruption. Either the brother had poisoned Magistrate Zhang's judgment or the two were in collusion.  Rather than wait to find out, I wrote to Governor Chen, an old acquaintance of sorts afterall, requesting a transfer to his canal project.  Before the end of my eleventh month at Funing, I received my wish.At about this time, Wang Ruo-fei, my old elementary school classmate who was now secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, was imprisoned by a warlord ally of Chiang Kai-shek's. Because Wang's father-in-law, Mr. Huang Qi-sheng (headmaster of my childhood school) was not an official communist party member but a venerable figure of national stature, he was left unmolested. It came as little surprise then when I received word that the restless old gentleman had decided to leave Guizhou, the place of his family's recent misfortunes, and travel to Shanghai, where he intended to open an agricultural school modeled after a certain work-study program he had experience of from back in his days with the boys in France. Mr. Huang's journey took him through Nanjing, where he sought me out, the reluctant protg he had once nudged out of our mountain nest to join the revolution.  We spent a couple of evenings together feasting and drinking and recounting the episodes of our lives since the juncture when he and Elder Uncle had seen my opium caravan off from Guiyang's main market square. He went so far as to invite me to Shanghai, and because I had a bit of time on my hands before reporting to the canal project, I took him up on the offer. Early October is an agreeable time in the great metropolis. An end to summer's furnace heat transfuses every street with a sense of relief and gratitude.  Couples stroll in the early evening; children play in the morning sunshine, the warmth of which is now appreciated. The songs of birds hang in the air like ornaments of sound, and when the birds dip their beaks to drink from bowls of water left out for them by children and the kind hearted, they bend back their tiny heads to swallow and to look up towards the sky as though in thanks to the heavenly emperor for this and the other benevolences of the season.I spent my afternoons at Mr. Huang's fledgling school, no longer the student but a peer.  Yet despite all that I had gone through in the last few years, having my advise, my advise sought by a grand figure of my childhood and youth actually resulted in a sense of ... false representation. I was all that long removed from the mountains. I felt a counterfeit, a charlatan. Still, my old master's confidence in me seemed to brook no contradictions. He insisted on hearing what I had to say, positively refusing to accept my begging off on any topic. The rapport between scholar and protg grew with every passing day until one evening the big-hearted gentleman broached a delicate issue while we sat together in his study listening to radio."It disturbs me," he said from the comfort of his easy chair, "that you have yet to resolve the problem of marriage.""To me," I responded distractedly, straining to follow the narrative line of the broadcast, "delay in marriage is not a problem.""What possibilities do you see," he asked with a lively smile, "in Miss Li?" The question immediately brought a warm blush to my face.  It struck me almost as lewd insinuation. I would have had had to be blind not to notice the physical (not to mention spiritual) attributes of Mr. Huang's charge, who lived in this household as the master's surrogate daughter. But honestly, I had never before this very moment allowed myself to think of her in any more intimate capacity than hostess."She would make a fine match for a scholar," commented Mr. Huang. "Though no intellectual, she's well-enough educated. What's more important, she values learning. She would cherish the work of her husband, support it with all her patience and resources. If you couldn't achieve your life's goals with her behind you, then you never could in the first place!"Mr. Huang's injunction seemed to conjure a whole array of pleasant images, some wholesome, some not. As we returned to listening to the broadcast, I could picture all too well a life in Miss Li's embrace. The sweet, unthinkable evenings together. The early mornings watching her tend to the chores of the bedroom and then the kitchen. The walks to early market, produce basket hanging from an arm. I saw myself working in my study as she prepared afternoon tea. I saw her combing our daughter's hair, as long and luxurious as her own. I saw myself helping our son learn how to count with his fingers. How could I not smile at the thought of what was to come and, even more so, the absurdity of such fictions I generated.For all my fantasies' vivid charms, there was another scene equally vivid but inescapably degrading: a school boy hunched over a desk receiving the paddling of his life. Miss Li's father had been an instructor of mine in Mr. Huang's original academy, and the idea that the perpetrator of so ignominious a punishment would someday be the one man I would address as "Father" stun me as much as the blows themselves once had. Another promising marriage prospect came to naught with the memory of a few solid whacks of a gentleman's cane.In late October, the canal project's chief engineer, a recent university graduate from Shanghai, rode out to the work site on a sedan chair hoisted on the bared shoulders of four peasant men. He appeared in a fine imported double-breasted suit before his army of over thirty-nine thousand labor conscripts, and when one worker slung mud at him, he berated his men as though they were spoilt children.  Five club-wielding guards proved as useless as match stick soldiers against the tide of incensed peasants. The haughty chief engineer and his thugs were beaten out of camp.When finally I arrived at the project, I found a company of a hundred armed troops as well as the twelve other foremen besides myself. Each of us took charge of roughly three thousand laborers, and work soon commenced along a thirty li stretch of one of the Yellow River's former courses, now a dry and relatively shallow gully, a long and winding depression in a landscape of sandy soil, tall wild grasses, abundant scattered scrub brush and the occasional clutches of anemic-looking trees.

7#$?wEF\F\rrr~j.x :p*KpP ppU6ppppppChapter 5: Canal DiggingPeasant laborers received wages proportionate to the amount of dirt they dug, but this method of reckoning soon proved untenable. With such large brigades under each foreman, deception was the order of the day. Workers dug and reburied their ditches time and again so that after several weeks of work, very, very little had been accomplished.  It was also the beginning of the rainy season. The Chinese-manufactured pumps we used for draining the excavation sites kept breaking down. It took at least five days for a pump to be sent to Suzhou, repaired and brought back. And it was never very long before a repaired pump broke down again.  We eventually abandoned these pumps for buckets. Thus, a task that should have taken hours now required a day or two.Several of the foremen, who had studied engineering in America, collaborated in designing our shelters. Canopy tents were erected using bamboo poles, hemp, woven bamboo mats and long sheets of heavy, oiled brown paper. They looked quite professional but displayed a penchant for collapsing during moderate winds with the result that we and the workers often found ourselves sleeping in the rain. Discouraged, most of the American graduates quit, and the brigades swelled to nearly four thousand ragged, discontented conscripts a piece.At the suggestion of the one remaining engineer, fresh funds were requisitioned for new shelters.  This time, rather than prescribing a set design, the moneys were distributed directly to the men themselves, who were given responsibility for their own accommodations. From the nearby towns and villages they purchased sturdy timbers, which were partially sunk into the ground.  Cross beams were lashed to the vertical timbers, and roof ribbing completed the frames. Finally, layers of thatch and dirt were piled high on top of the ribbing. Such shelters kept out the rain.  Needless to say, we foremen knew enough to copy the popular design.With respect to work, the brigades were now subdivided into platoons of twenty-five. At each platoon work site, a central pillar of undisturbed earth was retained for measuring the changing depth of excavation. The deeper the crew dug and thus the taller the central pillar grew, the more they were paid. The clay content of the soil, however, allowed these pillars to be sliced through at the mid-level, lifted up and augmented. Only, the incongruous coloring of the false strata bore witness to tampering. When we brought surveying theodolites to one work site to prove that the measurement pillars had actually risen above the levels of the embankments to either side, the men nearly broke out in a riot.  We had no choice but to withdraw and let the matter lie.One evening, a peasant boy stumbled into my personal camp. Bloody-faced and panting he stammered, "They've beaten me for my ration of rice!  And I've barely enough to eat as it is!""Who's beaten you?" I asked motioning the boy to take a seat around the fire."The others in my crew!" he blurted still standing and poised to run."Which others?" I asked.Using the back of his hand to wipe the blood from his mouth and nose, he said, "All the others!"Sure enough, twenty-four howling men came charging into the circle. As anyone might have guessed, their story was somewhat different."This cur's been dipping into our rice stores!" said a bare-chested young peasant puffing faint clouds in the chilly air."Dipping generously too," added another."He gives our food," shouted a third, "to the girls that lay him while we're out all day--""That isn't true!" cried the boy, who suddenly dropped to his knees very close before me and clasped his hands together as though in supplication."This boy," I said, "is the cook for your brigade?" "That's right, Excellency," confirmed a middle-aged peasant with strips of brown cloth wound round his head as a sweat turban. "He's too scrawny for the pit, but his cooking's not bad.""And these girls?" I asked."There aren't any girls," protested the boy looking up at me. "Where would I get girls?""Shut up!" I ordered."Peasant girls," explained the middle-aged man. "From nearby families. This is their way of making extra cash. It's like a side business.""Let us have the boy!" demanded the bare-chested peasant, pushing his rolled up sleeves even higher up on his muscular arms. "We'll teach him a lesson he won't soon forget!  You won't be bothered about this again!""The boy!" someone shouted. "Hand him over!""Nooo," shrieked the boy, and he threw himself at my feet, wrapping his arms around my ankles. "Don't let them take me, Excellency! They'll kill me!  For certain they'll kill me!"The moment, chaotic as it was, seemed to freeze in time. I suddenly thought of Shi, the boy orator who had lost his fingers during a warlord aerial attack. There he was again, holding fast to the legs of a man dangling from the top of a monastery wall."Shut up!" I yelled."We haven't had a scrap of food all day!" said one of the workers."And now we're hungry!" shouted the bare-chested peasant, gesturing wildly at the boy."Give us the boy!" rose a vengeful chant. "Give us the  boy!"Armed guards came up beside me and cocked their rifles. I shut my eyes and found myself balanced once more on top of the wall.  I saw dark forms in the distance and brilliant flashes of light. For one brief moment, Shi was pinned against the wall; then he slid down to the ground."STOP! STOP! STOP!" I screamed at the top of my lungs. As my voice broke, I opened my eyes, and the clamor instantly died away. "You're the platoon that's given to trampling the ground around your measurement pillar, aren't you? A new way of cheating the system!"The bare-chested peasant shot quick sidewards glances at his companions. The middle-aged peasant seemed unperturbed, and a faint smile crept into the boy's expression."Shall I have you whipped?" I asked him almost nonchalantly, wiping the grin from his swollen face.  "Or how about you?" I directed at the bare-chested man. "We've plenty of cane." I looked from one worker to the next. "From the state's point of view you are all as culpable and guilty as this lusty boy."Fearful of the armed guards, they knew better than to deny or argue."Look to yourselves," I warned. "And leave this boy to me. When he's reassigned to a new crew, I'll see to it that close tabs are kept. If he's caught stealing, I'll send him to the jail in Fu Ning, where the warden enjoys exercising a 'firm hand'."With that, I dismissed the riotous crew, and when they had gone, I told the boy to take food from my personal store of provisions and prepare a quick meal for his mates. Even as I issued the orders I felt languid and tired in a way I had seldom felt before and just as rarely since. My body became extremely heavy; I seemed to labor to breath. I longed to lay my head down on a pillow, to sleep and not to dream.To this day I cannot explain what overcame me. Though the confrontation had been unsettling, it had really been more noise and bluster than anything else. As for my memory of Shi's death? Well, I never really knew the lad that well to begin with. So I don't know. Perhaps it was Shi, or perhaps it was simply the canal, which was getting nowhere. The common objective of thirty-nine thousand peasants was to bide time doing as little as possible, collecting as much money as possible and leaving as soon as conscription was up or the state had exhausted its funds and thereby its capacity to hold them any longer. Thirty-nine thousand adversaries. Thirty-nine thousand saboteurs.Or perhaps it was my life, which seemed so much like this mess of a project to which I was tied. I thought about the woman Deng Lo-hua, who had transformed beyond recognition. And I thought about the girl Lan En-zhang whom I had left behind only five short years ago but what felt like fifty. Where was she? What was she doing? Who was she with? I fought my weariness until the food was ready and then delivered it myself to the camp of famished men.Ironically, it happened on one of the few clear mornings during that first December. On the daily inspection tour of his work site, one of the foremen came to a fateful bump in the trail. His bicycle stopped hard, and its handlebar snapped in two.  The foreman fell forward, driving the broken end of the handlebar stem through his throat. We found the poor fellow dead in a pool of blood, still impaled on the bicycle.Naturally, we lost faith in our Japanese-make bicycles and bought a few American and German models for trial.  We soon learned that the latter were best suited to our rugged terrain. More German bicycles were ordered, but this measure seemed to have very limited effect in quelling the dissatisfaction among the surviving foremen.  One by one, they submitted their letters of resignation to the governor's office until by the New Year I alone remained to oversee and prod, quell and appease an army of unruly men. One night in late January an old gentleman from a nearby town dropped by my camp for a visit. Community leaders were frequently on-site, so Mr. Wen and I were on familiar terms.  "It's cold tonight," I observed, struggling to stand up."And it will get colder," he said, gesturing for me to stay put. As he took a stool by the fire, I ordered one of the guards to bring our guest a few blankets, but he motioned for the man to desist.Dismissing the soldier, I ribbed, "This is no night for someone of your years to be out and about; trouble at home?" "No, no," he responded with a chuckle. "Nothing like that." Picking up a stick he poked at the embers. "If only we could have some of summer's warmth." He chuckled. "It doesn't seem at all fair or sensible. Boiling us from May to September and freezing us between December and February. Why not distribute the heat more evenly over the year? I  wouldn't object.""Nor I." Pulling tighter the pair of woolen blankets draped around my padded great coat, I smiled and nodded. For two weeks now I had had a fever and hacking cough. Thoughts of the project's desperate situation kept me up late into the nights and awoke me most mornings well before dawn. Still, this particular day I was strangely light-hearted despite the frigid air and winter skies. Perhaps I was finally getting used to the notion that revolution was distinct from reform and reconstruction. The former required but weapons and the willingness to shed blood. The latter depended on ... perseverance ... and luck."Director Zhou," he began again."'Little Zhou'," I corrected him. "I'm too much your junior for cordiality, and besides, I'm officially but the field accountant.""'Accountant'!?" exclaimed Mr. Wen. "In actuality, you are the very embodiment of this project in human form. Ambition!""Such absurdity!" I laughed. "I assure you, I'm just an accountant."He used his fingers to pinch closed the ends of his coat sleeves. "Even so, Mr. Lowly Accountant, how far do you reckon mere ambition and perseverance will take you and this project?"Looking to the old gentleman, I asked, "What do you mean?  I didn't take this thing on with any grand designs for myself, but I will to see it through to the end." "You misundersand me. That's my fault. Of course, you'll stay till the end, but how long before it comes?"I shrugged my shoulders, coughing into my fist and glancing about to see if any of the guards were in earshot. "You're crawling along at a turtle's pace," said the old man in a resonant voice that prompted me to raise my hands to control his volume. "Truthfully," he continued in a near whisper and leaning towards me, "not even that. Although you're constantly starting new work sites, the initial excavations are still so shallow. By the end of winter, you'll have used up all the money set for the year. By the end of the year, you will have spent the money allocated for the entire three years of the project. Do you think those hundred soldiers of yours will be able to coax more work out of the men?  Your workers are conscripts, taken against their wills from their homes and families.  They're not odd ducks like you; they don't want to be here. Give them half-a-chance and they'll fly. Just like those sensible foremen who abandoned you to this sorry predicament.""What exactly am I supposed to do?" I said feeling my blood rise. "Quit like all the rest? And if I don't quit, does that make me the fool?!"Two guards approached chatting amiably with each other, but I brusquely waved them away, eliciting looks of consternation."Not a fool," said Mr. Wen, his voice growing again, "just a little foolish. A little green and inexperienced."I hunched over and gripped my knees as I searched the old man's face. "Old Sir," I said trying to suppress my swelling anger, "can you tell me something I don't  already know?""Certainly!"Patting the air again to keep his voice down, I said, "What?"He wagged a finger at me and said unfettered, "Let the men of each county work together for a change. Don't keep them apart. And let them work as close to their homes as possible rather than as far away!""Be realistic," I admonished. "Nothing would ever get done!""No," said Mr. Wen shaking his head. "Nothing's getting done now!  Form county brigades and begin work across the entire length of the canal!"I opened my mouth but paused to think."Hold each brigade accountable for their own length of canal," explained my visitor, "and when it's done to satisfaction, let them disband." He shook his head again. "And not a day sooner. In the meantime as they work, they'll be close enough to their loved ones--""To be reminded of home," I whispered.The old man brought his palms together and cried, "Now you're getting it!""Their families," I mused sitting up straight, "will visit them often--""Bringing favorite dishes," finished my companion.I didn't even realize I had let go the blanket corners until they slid from my shoulders and fell to the ground. "Morale will be high," I continued. "They'll want to complete their obligations as quickly as possible. We'll make each county brigade responsible for an amount of work proportional to the county population." I turned away briefly before looking back to Mr. Wen.  "That will be fair; no brigade will have to dig more canal per conscript than any other.""Spot on!" Groping the ground behind me for the blankets I postulated, "And by starting construction along the entire length of the canal, at the end of three years, whether its shallow or deep, the canal will at least be complete.""You may not be able to sail an ocean cruiser to Hongze Lake, but the channel will certainly run through to the sea!""And the floods," I said, pausing to pile the blankets on the stool next to me and quickly rethink the simple deductive steps, "they'll be a thing of the past.... Won't they?""Perhaps," said the old gentleman nodding his head.  "If the sky permits."The very next day, I began arranging everything along the lines of Mr. Wen's recommendations, and the canal finally started to show signs of a significant beginning. But that wasn't all.  The new system displayed a will of its own when the thirteen county brigades subdivided into district teams. These, in turn, subdivided into village crews, which made their members individually responsible for a set length of canal without regard to how that obligation was met.  Soon, the richer households were hiring laborers to take the place of their young men.  Another unforeseen effect was the formation of 'town houses' where the brigade and team leaders spent their leisure evenings gambling and cavorting with concubines. This diversion became so popular, in fact, that the merry patrons frequently neglected to take their leaves of absence for visits home. The canal zone became a resort area of sorts, an economic boom zone. So this was reconstruction? Despite an ambivalence, I couldn't resist feeling positively optimistic.Two Skies     v|P,@8`H(HAps<@Z^dk%@Poz{'',,0001113i3n3344$4_4d44555K5Q66999c9j?e?i??????????F\FFFFFFFFFFGGG!G#G'GCGJGLGM@P@V z2odbxSmvR1   "G$K%%:&&y'*O*q*+o+,n-$$$$$$$$$B---1Q12\2333445h56677Y79a9n:M:;u;=???????FGMGwGGJSJaJcJJLVLvqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq,$Jp@P !$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C&$'`*0-/25p8@;=@C@$$$$$$$, of tedious, wet and exhausting effortTwoactually turned out to be an unusually rainy winter. transported and exhaustingcoldEpidemics of influenza and diarrhea broke out among the army of peasants.  twoas did several other of the foremen, one.

But even me, a brigade leader, with thousands of men under my supposed authority and a several armed guards at my beck and call, had still to tend to the ledgers, the engineering record books, the cooking for the evening, the washing of clothes, with my hands, using left-over dirty water from rinsing the pots and pans. the second logpots and pans, the washing of rinsing of the dishes and bowls and chopsticksThere was the tending to wounds, of myself and those who shared a shelter. The reminding of the guards to clean their rifles. The inspection of tools and food stores and blankets. The planning for the next days effort of trying to make a go at work.  I might have delegated some of these duties to a few of the literate among my masses, but, of course, there was there question of accuracy and honesty. Would other men have taken my penalty if things did not add up at the end of the month? Who would make up out of their own pockets for deficits in spending? And as for the labor chores, what would the workers have thought of a leader who had others do his share of cooking and cleaning? Respect and cooperation were hard enough to come by as it was. All this went on until late at night, king and cleaning? Respect and obedienceThe other brigade leaders were getting nowhere just about as fast as I was, but I still thought there might be a chance, so it seemed possibly shrewd to bank a bit of goodwill, to wait out the men in their obstinate refusal to cooperate, to see if the day might come that Governor Chen's mission would begin to speak to these poor local peasants who stood to gain the most from a viable canal.By ten or a little later at night all my duties were usually finally done for the day, and my eleven or eleven thirty I was sufficiently wound down to be able to lie down and rest my head and drift away from my worries and fall asleep.

7#$$hI;.W.WtttttwwwwLwh"wwxxtx x|*}.t|x ||,||||||Chapter 6: The Porcelain RiotOn the fourth day of our journey back to Pennsylvania we managed to make an early start of it in the morning; we were both anxious to get back home.  Jennifer's programs of country-western music were getting shorter and shorter just as were mine of new wave.  I suppose we were probably simply bored of listening to music on the radio.  When my mid-morning turn at choosing stations came I ignored the tuning dial and contented myself with the rush of the wind.Jennifer fished Father's story tape out from between the emergency brake lever and the driver's seat, where it had been wedged with an assortment of maps and newspaper remnants. "You want to listen to this?" she asked."Um?" I said, turning my head to take a closer look at the cassette even though I knew exactly what it was. "I didn't think you liked the last installment. Too much civil engineering."She examined the tape label on one side and then flipped it over to take a look at the other label.  "It was okay," she said.  "Which side? A or B?""We don't have to listen to it if you don't want to," I offered."I don't mind," she said. "No, really.""I guess it's side B, right? Last time we probably listened to A." She held up side B for me to read the label."Yeap," I said. "That's right."She switched on the cassette player and inserted the tape.The summer seemed almost upon us, so warm was the weather on certain days. But in reality, it was not yet May. Despite my years in the Southeast, my stock was still that of the southwestern mountains, so I counted the weeks with a mindful eye towards June, when I would again begin to lose sleep to sweltering nights.  It was during this pleasant but somewhat anxious respite that I received a correspondence from Li Qin-chang, a classmate from the academy.My friend's letter opened with a brief account of the situation in Nanjing, but it quickly progressed to weightier matters:China seems on a path to recovery. As long as the Japanese don't attack soon again, we will have the time we need. However, even if the Japanese are satisfied to leave well enough alone, we must eventually reckon with them. We must take back the land they have seized; we must make the country whole again! I know that you and I will do our part in what lies ahead--the last leg of this counterfeit peace and the inevitable war.  But Brother, we mustn't let these hard convictions control our fates. We must not stop moving forward.  There will always be calamities, always fresh struggles.  History never sleeps.We who marched north together know that the world is a bitter sea; our lives will forever be ships tossed by the waves. In spite of this, I at least enjoy an illusion of safe haven because my marriage is a buffer against the wind, a shelter from the rain. Good Brother, I want you to consider the words of a friend who has long kept your benefit in mind. You are much too alone.Li Qin-chang proposed a match with his cousin Li Nian-qin, whom I had encountered on a few occasions in the past.  She was thin and sickly, but this wasn't why I hadn't any interest.  Writing back, I praised Li Nian-qin for her ability and strong will, which I truly admired, but I graciously declined his proposition without providing specific reasons.  It was simply that history precluded lasting happiness, and I had no taste for illusion.In the first week of May, dark clouds gathered to smother the sky.  By the day's wane light we contemplated the storm's feathery black belly. The rain soon came down in torrents, clawing at the earth and gouging deep gullies.  Day and night we built sand bag walls to stay destruction from our camps. Water poured into the canal, spawning a churning river.When finally the rains abated, we ventured forth from our shelters to discover that the furious sky had done us a titanic service--the channel was now much deeper than before! With renewed optimism for a speedy end to their servtitude, the army of peasants applied themselves feverishly to draining the canal so that work could recommence. It was as this task neared completion that someone scraped his bucket against a wooden plank. A large chest was quickly uncovered, excavated and broken into.  Dozens of porcelain pieces, which by the seals they bore had evidently been destined for an imperial court, came into the light of day for the first time in centuries.A frantic search unearthed ten more treasure chests.  As I happened to be in the general vicinity, I got to the scene only an hour after the initial discovery.  Ideally, I had hoped to see the dishes and bowls laid out in neat rows beside their boxes although my realistic expectation was somewhat more modest. What I was totally unprepared for, however, was chaos and riot.  The canal was a seething river of men battling one another with their tools and bare hands. Of what I could make out, the porcelain lay scattered about in broken shards.  Upon my order, one of the armed guards discharged his rifle into the air, and its thunder clap brought an abrupt end to the mad struggle."What are you doing?!" I shouted to the mob. "These things you destroy could be priceless!" "It's worthless stuff," came a wry response from somewhere among the mass of mud-splattered and bloodied men."If it's worthless," I cried, "why do you fight?""It's from a dynasty!" a different voice answered."Yes, it is," I agreed. "And that's why you want it. That's why you fight.""Of course!" someone yelled as derisive laughter rippled through the crowd. "What else?!"Cocking their rifles, the guards looked to me nervously, and I gestured for them to lower their weapons. Once again I turned to the mob. "This treasure belongs to the  country!""It belongs to YOU!""Who says so?!" I shot back. "Who says so?!"From the thousands of anonymous faces came a quiet chuckle."I can't possibly claim this for myself," I cried, "because it belongs to the people, and I work for the people!""You work for the state!""But the state is the people, and the state claims this treasure for safekeeping on the people's behalf! We  are speaking of all the people, not just you! The porcelain must be sent to the capital! It is our duty!""Yes, Excellency, but will it be your pleasure?"A wave of laughter rose up to challenge me. The mob began to boil with angry voices. Hoes and shovels jabbed into the air like spears and halberds. My guards half-raised their guns."Comrades!" I shouted, again signaling the soldiers to steady themselves. "Brothers! I understand that our work is hard and the conditions difficult! You are paid a  pittance--""Then pay us what we're worth!""Pay us in porcelain! We'll accept!"I raised my arms. "If only it were mine to give!""Why did you start us digging this stinking latrine if you didn't have enough to pay us in the first place?!""Why did you drag us from our homes?!""Why pay us at all?!""Just make us your slaves! Sell us off whole or in pieces!""You're NOT my slaves!" I pleaded, shaking my head violently." Try  to  understand! You don't work for ME!  You work for the  STATE! You work for the COUNTRY; that is to say you  YOURSELVES!""We work for ourselves?" said a wizened old peasant close enough for me to make him out.  He turned his bald head to his thousands of brethren and nodded.  "His excellency says that we work for ourselves!"The mob grew even more restless than before; a hostile roar sprang up to pierce me a thousand times.I thrust with my finger at the old man's back. "When this canal is finished, that man will have water to irrigate his fields and the ability to take his crops to markets near and far! He will grow richer, and his children richer still!  THINK of it! THINK of it! When I have gone, you will remain! So do you WANT to build this canal?! Or do you want to go back to the lot you have always had ?!"Somebody smashed a piece of porcelain."Does that mean you're letting us go home?" came a cry."I haven't the authority," I said, shame-facedly. " I can only  ... resign my own post.""What did he say?!""I said I can only resign my post! And turn you over to another, better master!""Strangely, the commotion died away, and I waited to see what would happen next. Perhaps it was that I ate what they ate and slept where they slept. I didn't use the town houses; I rarely left at all when easily I could have. If the canal wasn't mine and I stayed of my own volition, then maybe they were better off with this fool than with another the state might appoint. I instructed the men to leave everything on the ground, and as they climbed out of the trench, filing past me and the guards, there came to my ear a quiet pronouncement--"liar". It didn't surprise me that I wasn't believed.  For I didn't really believe myself.In the end, a single chest of porcelain was recovered. I have no idea how much of the rest was broken or stolen. A few days after the riot, one of the workers died from his injuries.Two Skies     vwhat I think I actually grew nostalgic a little for the cold and damp of winter not that long gone by.

7#$\;fWfW///=SSS_j.x/$ Q*{K+/Q1 QQ;,QQQQQQBlames himself for death of his old fiance, would she be alive if he had not left her alone in the mountains?he had been seeing to Governor Chen's dreamsChapter 7: Wife, Father and the Lap of the SeaLi Qin-chang sent me a second letter. In this one he mentioned another possible love matcha girl named Li Bing-ze. Through a chance meeting at my friend's house some time ago I was already acquainted with Miss Li. An engineering graduate of Qinghua University, one of the best schools in the country. She was certainly the most capable of the several young women that had recently been brought to my attention; she also happened to be the most beautiful."Her father," explained my friend in his letter, "had been an avid hunter in his prime, but one day while cleaning his rifle, it had accidentally discharged. His wife, who had snuck up from behind to peer over his shoulder, was shot in the head and instantly killed.  From that time forward, he had devoted his life to his daughter, seeing to it that she received every advantage.  Her university education had been completed in America, but rather than accept a position there, she had returned to China to work in Beijing and live with her father."For some time after the receipt of this fresh proposal, I made no reply. I didn't know how to rebuff Li Qin-chang a second time, not for want of words but for want of conviction.  If ever a sorry young man fell in love with a heroine from afar, I fell in love with Li Bing-ze.  She would be my redemption, saving me from the heaviest burden of them allloneliness. But a wife and a home would be as vulnerable as a match box, liable to be pulverized by destiny's heavy hand and ground into dust. Unlike the moth, which is oblivious to its danger, I gravitated towards the flickering flame fully aware of the tragedy that would surely someday consume my fragile spirit. Nevertheless, I began to make secret plans, almost against my own will. But at the same time as I did so, a fog of conscience arose to confound both desire and better judgement.In his letter, Li Qin-chang had broached the topic of marriage with the phrase "if my cousin Li Nian-qin doesn't appeal ..." In this statement I heard an accusation of ingratitude. Without my dear friend I could not even dream of a golden match with Li Bing-ze, and yet I had flung insult in his face by rejecting a cousin!Moreover, in so doing I had given little enough thought to her welfare. Li Nian-qin's that is. She was divorced and without a vocation while Li Bing-ze was a professional engineer! The longer I dallied, the heavier grew my guilt until, finally, the scales tipped, and my aspirations for happiness were surrendered.  I finally wrote back to Li Qin-chang expressing interest in a formal introduction to his cousin.  Four months later, at the height of a hellish summer, we were married during my first and only personal leave from the canal.  Any danger of falling in love again had passed.My life with Li Nian-qin started inauspiciously when she fell ill on our wedding night. It had been suffocatingly hot under the mosquito net; the surface of the reed sleeping mat had been slick with sweat. The bowls of white spirits imbibed at the wedding feast had made even my ears ring, so it might only have been expected that a pale, reedy woman would succumb.  Her recovery was excruciatingly slow. But in spite of poor health, she moved to a town close to the canal.  Three months later when she was recovered, she took a job as a local school teacher.Li Nian-qin was sometimes cheerful, never effervescent and often given to brown moods.  She knew how to play her frailty to the hilt in wheedling from me whatever she wanted. When more buried porcelain was recovered and I identified the seal as that of a Ming Dynasty kiln, she badgered me for weeks, carrying on and on about her weak heart and certain early grave without the Western medical attention that we could presently ill afford but that the price of a few Ming plates would surely buy. Peace was restored only after I consented to let her "store" some pieces in our house for the time being.My wife was quick with a turn of phrase and a sardonic twist so that she normally prevailed in our endless disputes over everything from party politics to the proper preparation of tea eggs. Going home became a chore, then a trial, and I never overcame my physical revulsion to the woman so that after two years we were still without child.  What the warring factions had done to our country, what the ignorant canal workers had done to the precious porcelain, I had managed to do to my private life.In the winter of 1937, Magistrate Zhang of Fu-ning county was assigned to the rich jurisdiction of Ru-gao county. I can imagine how pleased this must have made him since the prospects for embezzlement there were far richer than in Funing. Before the appointment's finalization, however, the governor's office asked Magistrate Zhang whether his brother would be accompanying him to Ru-gao.  A thinly-veiled precondition: if his brother went to Ru-gao, the magistrate would not. My former boss was positively livid. He saw my invisible hand behind the plot although I had provided our superiors with absolutely nothing to incriminate his brother.In retaliation, Magistrate Zhang hatched a minor plot of his own, requesting my transfer from the Huai Canal project to his new staff at Ru-gao. I would be plucked from the magnificient endeavor a few months short of its completion, which meant that another man would reap the credit. My glory would be forfeit.  His request was approved by the provincial finance director Zhao Di-hua, but unfortunately for the rankled magistrate, my personal patron  the provincial water projects director Xi Xing-wu enjoyed more influence in this matter than his.  Before the transfer orders could be formalized, Director Xi protested to Governor Chen. Director Xi knew that the greater credit for the canal project would go to the governor but only if it was successfully finished. Hence, he still needed a competent site officer. Governor Chen, the future acclaimed visionary, agreed, and I was kept in the field.By March, the long undertaking was quickly drawing to a conclusion. There was still a ways to go before the canal would be deep enough, but our funds were nearly exhausted. I had already dismissed several thousand workers. One of them, an old peasant with shrewd eyes, came to my camp before departure to tell me of a trenching device known to his great grandfather as "the dragon that loafs in the sea." On a hunch that the tip was good, I traveled to Shanghai and searched the city's libraries and archives until I found an ancient civil engineering treatise that detailed the dragon's "anatomy" and dimensions.Its body consisted of hundreds of thick bamboo poles lashed together into a long, prickly, spiral spine that spun and snaked while being towed downstream.  This action scoured the channel bottom and kicked sediment into the current to be flushed out to sea.  I drew up crude plans for the creature's modern-day resurrection and calculated a fresh budget. My proposal was submitted to Director Xi, who quickly grasped the possibilities and gave his full approval. Still, there were unavoidable budgetary constraints, and the "loafing" dragon was put off until the following summer.  In the meantime, I gathered my peasant army one final time.Forty thousand haggard faces looked up to me. Forty thousand pairs of eyes stared at mine.  There were many smiles, but the dirt on their limbs and the rags on their backs gave mute testimony to countless days of toil and hardship, endless nights of cold and damp. The sunshine was bright, yet in my memory those faces remain streaked by rain. The words from our last exchange were few; forty thousand men had nothing to say on their own behalf.  I, on the other hand, felt compelled to give some brief account of our shared ordeal and to thank them for all that they had borne. I also begged their forgiveness, and at last, I set them free.Shortly after disbanding my army, I was called to the provincial water projects office, where I was received by Xi Xing-wu."Mr. Zhou," said the director, who was as thin a rake as Governor Chen but not in the least bit phlegmatic, "these past three years I've followed closely the progress of the Great Huai Canal. The job you've done can only be described as stupendous and unparalleled.  Truly, the governor's pledge to the people will be fulfilled."I thanked my director by lauding the governor's great foresight."I've discussed the matter of your reward with the governor, and the idea came up of a trip abroad."I must admit that I very much warmed to the idea of an overseas holiday but at the same time felt tradition-bound to decline, which I did."Actually," said Director Xi, "we had in mind something a little bit more substantial than a vacation.  How does the prospect of graduate study strike you?""Graduate study?" I wasn't quite certain that I had heard correctly. Mr. Xi had himself attended the University of Iowa and was renowned as a scholar. Did the man have a similar opportunity in mind for me.  "Graduate study," I repeated, and my superior nodded confirmation. "The idea," I uttered, "strikes me as ... wonderful.""Good," said Director Xi. "The governor has already allocated funds. You will certainly want to thank him, but first tell me where you would go and what you would study.""Japan?" I suggested, and my superior eyed me suspiciously. I hastily explained that I was only thinking about saving the treasury a bit of money, so he smiled and asked, "What is your heart's desire?"Without thinking, I answered, "Why America, of course, is where I want to go."Immediately, Director Xi consented and then went on to propose agriculture as a course of study, the better for developing vast new crop lands within the canal zone. "Cotton", he said, "will be a likely future cash crop since my office predicts a great market for this particular commodity."While I realized I would continue being a tool for the provincial regime, the promised benefits were clearly mutual. And, frankly, I had no objections to manipulation as long as this tool could be a useful one. As fate would have it, the president of the Louisiana State University was in Shanghai at the time, and a meeting was arranged.  He was delighted to interview a "young Turk" of the Nationalist regime and tickled to consider my placement in his university. His people could teach me everything there was to know about cotton. As for my English, which might wish for a bit of "polishing", he was confident that it presented no real problem.  Truth be told, without a quick and nimble translator the American would not have understood a thing I said or vice versa. But he was good to his word; it took only four weeks for his university to formally accept me. By the time I received the letter of admission, my personal affairs were already in order save for one final obligation.Governor Chen Guo-fu's new executive suite was surprisingly similar in scale to the office I had visited years earlier as a cadet. Large in dimensions. High of ceiling. The major difference was light. Thick curtains were kept drawn so that even at mid-day darkness prevailed. It took several minutes for my eyes to adjust. But once the shadowy forms became distinguishable, I saw that, as before, the windows were tall and the room's expansive conference table was covered with papers, charts and books. There were the things one would expect of a government executive office, such as chairs and desks and painting scrolls and plants on pedestals as well as things unexpected, such as a rifle and a sword, for some reason out of it scarbard and set against the wall.The governor himself no longer sat at a large desk, but lay on his side on a thin-mattressed cot with a low table placed next to the cot, a lit lamb on the table and documents strewn over the floor. The man wore a large nightgown seemingly of the lightest cotton so that one imagined that in stronger light the contours of his body might be visible through it. Rumor had it that beneath the gown, beneath the bandages wrapped around his narrow chest, was a wound in his backa surgical incisionthat never healed and through which one could spy certain internal organs. The lung perhaps. What else? The sheath of muscle over the ribs had apparently not healed after surgery or had wasted away. Three aides sat close by to hold up papers for their master, to take memoranda, to mop his brow with moist towels and to catch with a silver bowl the blood-streaked phlegm that he coughed up in great quantities."Governor Chen," I said, "I've come to thank you for all you have done for me." Standing next to one of the aides, I wondered if the glare of a lamp set close to his face masked me from his vision.With his head stationary on the pillow, the great reformer rolled his eyes in my direction. His hand motioned feebly. With his other hand, he seemed to finger the soft fabric of his gown. There were small white buttons, looking a little like sectioned pearl, which I tried to will him to touch for their presumed smoothness and coolness. His fingers strayed in a direction away from the buttons. In a voice soft as the grave yet still unmistakeably purposeful and resolute, he said, "It is I who must thank you.... What you have done ... will be remembered ... for generations.""It is your name, which will live on.""Do you think so?" He chuckled, as though at a private joke. He looked down towards his feet, which I expected to wiggle but remained perfectly still. He rolled his eyes upward. He was perhaps looking in his mind towards something else. "Do you really think so?" For the love of his country, the man had worked himself to death. The body was as good as gone. There remained now but the spirit.We exchanged a few more remarks, most of them banalities, and then he drew the interview to a close by raising a finger and wishing me luck in America. He coughed into the silver bowl, already held up to his chin by an aide. Another brought forth a tablet of paper and asked, "Shall I pick up reading where I left off when he came in?""Study hard," Governor Chen told me, "and come home as soon as possible."I took my leave, and an aide saw me to the door.As I departed the realm of shadows and stepped into the bright and airy corridor, I felt strangely emotional, as though, I imagined, I had just left the side of a dying parent. I had seen him but twice, each time for no more than a few minutes. I told myself that he was still a politician; he wasn't really another Li Bing, river tamer, savior to his people. He was probably as corrupt as all the rest, but then again ... he had remembered me. Even those many years ago when all that distinguished a rebellious adolescent was a curious, self-righteous letter of complaint, he had known who I was. I could not have expected as much attention from my own father, except perhaps when he needed money. Ironically, it was only now at the end of my revolutionary career that I finally encountered the spirit that kindled revolutions, that sparked the ambitions of young men and that sustained the hopes of ancient nations. Would that I could have given this man yet in his prime, dying of some incurable disease, my blood and my body. Would that I could will him to sit up in his cot and to rise to his feet and to walk out the door of that dark chamber. Chen Guo-fu was, in a way, my true father, and it pained me deeply to see him suffer.In early September my wife accompanied me to Shanghai where she saw me off at the quay. Looking out over the crowds on the docks from the ship's railing, I rejoiced in the fact that my feet were planted on the deck of an ocean liner bound for Seattle and the fabled West. The polished wooden railing felt reassuringly firm in my grasp although a little tacky from the oil off of other peoples' hands or the salt sea air, I didn't know which. Behind me were the white-painted walls of the upper decks, and rising above the highest deck were gray smokestacks belching out puffs of black.I set a foot on a horizontal metal bar of the railing and looked out over the faces far down below on the dock looking up.  I found the face of my wife and fixed on it as her sad peculiar eyes, which did not slant inward toward her nose but outward down toward her ear lobes, seemed to be fixed on mine. As we set sail, I watched my wife until I lost sight of her in the receding crowd. I must admit to feeling relieved at being at long last rid of her but ashamed to feel so. In my mind I promised to send for her as soon as I had settled in and saved enough money. However, the thought of this reunion dampened my spirits, and so I tried to train my mind only on where I was headed. The United States. However, I knew so little of that country, that my mind drew blanks, and my mood remained level.After lunch, which was taken in a large, sumptuous canteen with hanging chandeliers, I toured the ship with a stylish young couple from Suzhou city. They took me down description of shipThey filled me in on the evening's events, which included a ball. I had never before attended a dance, and the anticipation of it made me want to pick up my pace and pump my arms. Nevertheless, I held myself in check. And I and the Suzhou couple strolled the deck for some time longer, enjoying the sunshine and sea breeze. Eventually, however, I excused myself for a nap and went below decks. Inside my cabin, I sat down in an easy chair to savor novel sensations. I was in the lap of luxury, to which I had arrived under the power of personal achievement. I also knew that I was on my way to the land of the 'devils' and that my life's great work might already lie behind me.  Still, for some reason these doubts and misaprehensions were easily distanced.I touched the tattered edges of an opened envelope in my jacket breast pocket.  It was yet another letter from Li Qin-chang, which relayed news about our old classmate and my first lover Deng Lo-hua.  She had given birth to a boy, and her lame hunchbacked husband continued to work as a secret policeman.  From the inner pocket of my suit I extracted an unopened envelope, from my mentor the itinerant school master Huang Qi-shen. I ripped it open to remove a few sheets of crisp, tissue-thin stationary. The letter read:  My dear Cheng-xu,For some weeks now I have debated the wisdom of this communication. A few short years ago I think I would have elected to conform to tradition and let you go without a word of the truth on the rationale that ignorance would have been more conducive to your studies. This letter would then have been a simple note of cheer and optimism, sending you off with well-wishes for your time in America.Afterall, you are far removed from our native mountains not just geographically but in terms of time and events. What does your heart really still retain of the youths we both once taught and guided? But I am one who has suffered blood losses; some of the boys I led to France are now gone. My own beloved Wang Lo-fei languishes in prision. It is their memories that compels me to rethink my ways. A revolution of personal conviction. Precisely because I believe that those eighteen boys and girls you tutored and then brought to me continue to occupy a place in your mind and heart, I cannot spare you the pain of truth in the illusion that it will permit the pursuit of career and happiness without consequence. Nothing is without consequence. The past must to be confronted, and the pain of consequence borne. The bearing of this pain may make you stronger--more feeling and compassionate, more impassioned--but it is as likely to drain you of strength, leave you bitter and broken. The risk and struggle must be accepted; there is more to this life than revolution, more to this existence than political redemption. Forgive me if I err.Due to my persuasion, all of our eighteen students joined the Chinese Communist Party. Lan En-zhang--the girl about whom you once spoke so enigmatically--married a protg of mine, also a school teacher. You tried to hide your feelings, but I could see how it really was between the two of you. I knew how punished you must have been never to have returned. That is why I did my best to find for you a suitable match; I wanted to bring something into your life to supplant that which had been lost. As for Lan En-zhang, know now that she loved her husband, who was totally devoted.This couple possessed a rare happiness, which culminated in the birth of a beautiful child, a girl. Today she resides with her grandparents. Lan En-zhang's brother, Lan En-fu also lives; he presently serves as a captain in the Red Army. Zhou Guang-yu, the girl you saved from the clutches of the telegraph master, is the other survivor. As for Lan En-zhang, her husband and our fifteen other students, they were all captured by the Nationalists. Lieutenant Governor Han ordered them buried alive. When muffled cries could be heard beneath the surface, swords were thrust into the ground to silence them. Without reading another word, I refolded the note and slipped it back into its envelope. Laying the envelope on my lap, I gazed out my port window at the shimmering expanse of the Pacific."Here I am," I whispered to Lan En-zhang, " on my way to the West, like Tripitaka fetching the sacred scriptures of Buddha. Only my pilgrimage is not for enlightenment, and my destination is so far west that I must sail east to reach it."That first love had possessed the enchantment of chastity and ardor of denial.  I was glad for her that she had known happiness, which had always eluded me. And what of Deng Lo-hua?  I was lying in the lap of the ocean, breathing the scent of its spray. Lan En-zhang was somehow riding the waves and Deng Lo-hua had sunk beneath them.  The drowsy rocking of the ship lulled me into a revelry.  Lan En-zhang smiled shyly, and I felt Deng Lo-hua's cool breath on my brow.  I heard the girl's whisper, I caressed the woman's body.  As the gulls outside cried mournfully, I once and for all fled Deng Lo-hua's perfume-smothered apartment to haunt a tiny make-shift school room in a remote mountain town, a spartan academy with its pure air and long drawn curtain, our irresistible veil of secrets. I looked into Lan En-zhang's eyes as though for the first time and held her gaze forever.Buried alive, as was the Lieutenant Governor's habit.  Han Wen Huan, executioner of thousands. Using the earth itself as his henchman. What a clever boy he had been even those many years ago when I had nicknamed him 'the hawk' during our holiday treks across the mountains. How could this possibly be mere coincidence? A boyhood chum grown up to be death's ambassador had somehow gotten to my students, to my beloved, through ME!!!"What have I done?" I cried, convulsed by pain. "What have I done!" Why, why, why did they ever have to meet me and listen to my glib seductions? Revolution! For what?! For what?! I started to shake and choke on my sobs. Bitter tears washed my cheeks like salt rain. My seat became an electric chair, but I would not have cut off the searing current for anything in the world. It was a just execution.Two Skies     ve spirit th, the spiritstrange and My life.

A far cry from the delapidated wooden floor of my old warehouse school back in the mountains. My guidestook me to a bar with tall wooden stools with bell-shaped glasses hanging upside down above the bar tenders, who wore spotless white aprons and who greeted us with smiles and foreign words. They led me up cramped staircases in which the sound of our hard leather shoes clapping against the steps had an odd quality about it. They led me along the main-deck promanade, parallel to the railing, past passengers laid out on "lawn chairs", to an area where some people were playing at a game that involved round disks and "T" shaped wooden mallets for pushing the disks over a divided triangle painted onto the deck.I might have stayed in Hong Kong years before and been acquainted with sea gulls and albatrosses, but the sight of such birds, larger than their counterparts on land, gliding through the air at a speed to match our ship, seemingly motionless in air, filled me with a sense of strangeness, of exoticness.

Soon the dirt was in their mouths, their noses, their eyes and their ears. They could see nothing. They could hear nothing. But they could feel the intermittent weight of people trampling on top. They thought of their lives; they thought of their mothers and their fathers; they thought of their children. They moaned or they cried as the dirt pushed further into their mouths or down their throats. They felt the warmth of the other bodies around them. They could not breath from the weight of bodies and earth and from the earth in their nostrils. They thought of their school days and their days of play. They thought of the green of grass and the yellow of flowers. They thought of the insects nibbling at their flesh and worms wiggling into their ears.

The girl stood looking up as though mesmerized, showing not the least sign of boredom with the monotonous sight of her bird of prey. When the boy came to the end of the line, the paper wings of the hawk seemed to billow out more leeward. There was a jerk on the line, and the boy, caught off guard, lost hold of the handle. The hawk flew off, dipping left then dipping right in an apparent descent towards the sea. The little girl immediately burst into the tears. Her brother, obviously the older of the two siblings, was perhaps just as horrified by the loss of the kite but he had, afterall, also to contend with the public spectacle created by his sister.

Things may change. Or maybe if you just act like Cary Grant the world will start acting towards you like C.G. At least a little.J feels better nonetheless. Chapter 8: A Picnic in MichiganBy eleven o'clock the sun had burned away the morning clouds, and the day was quickly warming up. Having already traveled for nearly four hours, we decided to stop for lunch. We found a fast food place in a small Michigan town and drove through the quick-order circuit with the plan of taking our meals to a public park. By luck, within a mile we came upon a sort of village green and parked in front of it.  As we walked across the thick uncut grass Jennifer asked, "So was that woman Mom?""Which woman?" I said."The one Dad left in China. The one he left alive. On the docks in Shanghai.""You mean Dad's first wife?" I chuckled. "No, of course not. How could you confuse her with Mom?" I pointed at a park bench surrounded by several trees, and we angled towards them."How long were they married?" she asked."I'm not exactly sure," I said. "Maybe ... six or seven years? Including the time Dad was over here in grad school. They divorced while Dad was still at Baton Rouge; she'd found another man.""Did they have any kids?" said Jennifer."No," I answered quickly. "Are you sure?""Of course!" I looked back over my shoulder at the car as though we were still in the city with the potential peril for auto theft. "He said so in one of the tapes.""I guess he might not have had really strong feelings for her.""That's true. But he was loyal while it lasted."Jennifer nodded. "How did Dad meet Mom?"I didn't answer."Did they meet in China?" she persisted as we arrived at the park bench and sat down."I'm not sure," I said, opening my brown paper bag. "I mean, I guess they did meet once briefly in Shanghai. Yeah, that's right. A mutual friend arranged the introduction." I stuck my hand into the bag and pulled out a yellow styrofoam box.Still clutching her bag, Jennifer asked, "What do you mean 'once briefly'? Do you mean that after the intro Mom came over here, and then they got to know each other better?"Opening the styrofoam box, I removed my cheeseburger and took a bite. "Actually," I mumbled, "I think they got to know each other mainly through letters." I jabbed a straw through the perforated circle in the plastic lid of my soda and took a sip. "They didn't get to know each other really well until after the wedding. But I guess that may be actually true for a lot of married couples." "You mean," said Jennifer, her voice faltering, clutching her bag so tight that I worried the food inside might get squashed, "Mom was like a mail-order bride or something?!""No!" I denied. "It wasn't like that at all! The story's really complicated!" Cheeseburger in hand, I pointed anxiously at her bag, which she released, letting it rest on her lap. "You've got to understand. There was a lot going on during that period. Not just in their lives, but in that whole part of the world. In the entire  world! They just got swept along. Mom and Dad weren't free like we are today to do what we will, go where we want." I put my sandwich back in its box. I patted my knee, trying to form an argument. "They were separated by an ocean, but they were still together in their hearts. Through letters, you see? Sometimes you can say a lot that way. More than in person."Jennifer frowned. "Do you think ... you know ... do you think that he really loved her? Mom that is."I smiled. "Of course he did. You know that.""Well," said Jennifer finally opening her bag. "He wasn't that nice to her a lot of the time. Never helping around the kitchen.""No," I agreed, more than a little surprised to see that Jennifer had seemingly traveled down the same path of reasoning I had."He didn't even help that much around the house. Mowing the lawn, shoveling snow and stuff? You remember how Mom used to spend entire days painting the house? She'd climb up ladders wearing those long, tight Chinese dresses of hers? It's a wonder she never fell!""Yeah," I said, unable to resist a smile. I could just picture my tiny mother up our aluminum extension ladder in her silk dress of sky blue, a white painter's cap sitting on top of her head like a puff of cloud. "But we helped!""Sure," dismissed Jennifer, "but Mom still did most of the work herself." She shook her head. "You've got to admit."Closing my styrofoam burger box against a pair of pesky flies, I waved my hand to shoo them away. "One summer I scraped and painted most of the roof eaves practically by myself.""How come I don't remember that?" asked Jennifer."I don't know," I said annoyed. "Maybe you weren't around that much." I glanced at my sister. "Maybe you were out with your friends most of that summer. But surely you remember the time Herb and I reshingled the roof! I mean, how could you possibly forget the afternoon when your friend Mary and her three-year old daughter were over visiting, and Herb and I came in through the living room window? Nearly gave the kid a heart attack!""The roof," snapped Jennifer, "doesn't count! It's something Mom wouldn't have attempted by herself anyways, so you and Herb didn't save her any trouble."She had a point there, which I didn't care to admit, so I momentarily held my tongue.  But before long, I needled, "You and I could've done more, couldn't we? Instead of hanging out all the time and all.""Dad's the one who should have done more!" countered Jennifer. "We were just kids!""How about when we were teenagers?" "He was the man in the family."I looked down at the dirt patch beneath our bench and spotted a file of ants working their way across their Sahara. The bread crumbs in their pinchers looked like giant boulders. "He should  have done more," I finally agreed. "But Mom wouldn't let him to get around to things in his own time, so when she'd start without him, he'd just let her go right on ahead. Out of pride and stubbornness, out of spite. Still, aren't you the same way? I mean, I am. Can't stand to be nagged. It was power struggle, sure. And very, very petty. But still only human.""Oh Guang," said Jennifer. "He'd procrastinate on everything forever.""He was tired," I said. "He was already in his fifties, actually close to sixty when he got that job he had when we were little. And then they kept laying him off. To get a job in our university he actually had to lie about his birth date." I shook my head. "They would never have hired him if they'd known his true age. It was a last stand; if he lost that position too he might not have recovered. The family might not have recovered. Remember how he use to force himself to go back to the office in the evenings after dinner?""Maybe," said Jennifer coldly."Mom said he was playing with his life. He'd get sooo tired.""Mom got tired?" growled Jennifer. "She was tiny and frail. I'll bet you she got five times  more tired than he did! And she never 'nagged' at him! Geeez Guang! Why do you always take his side?  Why do you always defend him? Why?!"I could see it all again. Father taking his bottle of beer before dinner, his glass of wine or cup of whiskey. The insults and jokes soon followed, and Mother's heart became the bull's eye for his games of verbal darts."If Dad had helped just a little more," said Jennifer, "then Mom might still be alive today."My mother, the general's daughter raised to a life of privilege, was as delicate as a porcelain doll. The bruising fatigue of taking care of a household and raising a family in an alien land had simply beaten her down."He's guilty!" said Jennifer.Once more I pictured Mother's face puffed up so much on the one side that her eye swelled shut. She sat slumped over a table, her head on her hand, too tired even to get up and put herself to bed. "I know," I admitted, "I know.""If he was so exhausted from work," said Jennifer, "why did he spend so much time at political rallies? Those took up entire weekends! Didn't that require energy?" "He was trying to ... to justify his life," I explained. "He'd fought so hard for his country.  It's not even that simple! You see, to us, you and me, our parents are in a way our country, but to Father, who really had no parents, his country was his family. He felt an obligation or duty towards country that cut deeper than everything else. It's not that he consciously wanted to make Mom and us second priority."Jennifer looked away in the direction of a row of white panel houses, not a soul to be seen. "And that's why Lucky had to die? That's why people harassed us and threatened to bomb us?"I searched the cloudless sky for a single bird. But for insects, we might have been the only living creatures left in town. For that matter, the world. "He tried to feed us propaganda," she said weakly, "tried to make us hate America, make us into little traitors?""He wasn't trying to make us traitors. He taught us to love  our country. Both  our countries.""Don't you miss her?" she asked, her voice forlorn, her spirit rended."Why, yes," I said, "of course.""Then how can you not hate him?" Her bag of food slid off her lap and fell to the dust as the tears welled in her eyes."I can't defend him," I said. "I've blamed him too." Jennifer shook her head and hissed venomously, "I've had enough of those tapes.""It wasn't that hewanted to be mean," I appealed. "He simply couldn't help it, see? Like when you're in pain from a headache or toothache. You want to be pleasant and nice and all, but you end up being mean and cranky."For him, the past is so big. Too much happened. Too many horrible things. He couldn't get away from them no matter how hard he tried, how fast he walked. They were always right there walking beside him, sitting down to dinner with him, stealing into his dreams. That's what the nightmares were all about. Those students of his, buried alive. Come back to lay the finger of blame. Even his most cherished memories became a curse. He had all that time, all those years to remember, to plead with ghosts that dogged him halfway around the globe. Don't you see? We can't condemn him because he's already condemned."Her effort to suppress the tears caused the corners of her mouth to arch downwards. I put my styrofoam box down on the bench beside my cup and reached into my bag to take out a couple of paper napkins, which I held out to Jennifer but she pushed away."Don't be so hard on him. I mean, we're pretty much the same. Slaves to the past.  What if someday we stand accused before our children? Wouldn't we wish that they could know a little bit of how things were like in our day?""Will we ever have kids?" asked Jennifer."I ... I hope so.""We're the way we are because he made us so." She shook her head. "He made mistakes. Lots of them.""Yes," I said."You want me to think that he did his best," said Jennifer contemptuously, "but doing your best isn't good enough. It's like a test. Unless you get an 'A', it doesn't count." She grinned. "That's what he would say.""Do you remember," I said, "when you were real little? Three or four maybe? And I was still a baby? At nights, you'd to want to dance with Dad, so he'd put on a record, and he'd dance with you holding your hand, and in his free arm he'd carry me. Then when you got tired, he'd put you to bed, but you'd wake up and cry every time he left your side. So he'd stay a long time, until very, very late at night and you were fast asleep. Can you imagine how tiring that must have been? And can you imagine how much he must have ... well, loved you?""How would you remember any of this?" said Jennifer caustically."Dad told me," I answered. "Last summer, when I was taking care of him." I looked at my sister, hoping to read clemency in her expression. But her face seemed immovably angry. "You may not credit this," I added, "but Mom really loved Dad."Jennifer started to cry, and through her sobs she said, "Mother told me ... that if she had known Dad was going to be like the way he was ... she would never have married him." I held out the napkins again, but Jennifer let the tears stream down her face. I confessed, "She used to say that to me too, but always in anger, always after they'd had a fight or something.""No. Not always. She said it to me when she was calm.""But you weren't there for that second operation!" I cried. "You didn't see how she kept trying to get that wedding ring back on her finger! It was so terribly swollen! She kept trying and trying! She loved Dad! ""I don't believe it!" said Jennifer pounding the park bench with a fist. "I don't!""Things were good for them the last ten years!  He stopped drinking! Maybe it was just that we weren't around anymore to worry about; he didn't take things one day at a time like Mom. Or maybe it simply took that long for him to leave the past behind a little bit. For the wounds to heal enough that they weren't always distracting him.""I won't believe!" shouted Jennifer. "You're just defending him again! Making excuses!"I drew a deep breath and tried to control my shaking. A bird alighted on a branch above our heads, but within seconds, flew away again."They went to senior center together," I said pacing my speech, searching for the words to make her understand. "In the afternoons, they went to the pottery studio. Why ... come summer they even did art shows  together! With a little booth? Where they'd sit together all day and talk to people? And just for fun, they'd write kid's names in Chinese on little slips of paper. There'd be these long lines of kids. But you've seen that; you must  remember!"Her crying began to subside. She wiped her face with the back of her hands. I bent over and picked up Jennifer's bag, brushing away the ants and placing it on the bench next to mine. "Ten years of happiness," I said, "and now his punishment has resumed.""Ten years of happiness," she mimicked, "and now she's dead."I bowed my head feeling spent and defeated."I know," said Jennifer, "that we were a lot of trouble. We made her tired too.""Yeah," I said.Jennifer shook her head. "Maybe it was mainly us that made her tired." "In those last ten years," I said, "Mom smiled a lot. And that's what really counts. The happiness she did find. All the bad things ... she simply left them behind. The way Mom smiled, you'd think they never happened."A young boy came out the front door of a house diagonally across the green. He bounded down the steps and picked up his bike, which had been lying in the grass. Pedaling hard, he raced down the street and turned a corner."That's how it will be for us too someday. When things get better these hard times will become nothing more than memories. Our problems will stop badgering us, clouding our days. You don't dwell on rain when the sun is shining.""Can you guarantee it?"Life's randomness was what made it bearable, even hopeful. For things always turned and changed despite the illusion that time stands still. We had simply to persevere, to wait out the wait, to cross the desert expanse however much of it there was. Not let the sun and monotony sap our strength and spirit, melt our resolve. Not surrender to pessimism and despair, so that when the oasis finally appeared upon the horizon, our eyes would still be open and our courage intact to seize the moment before it reverted again to mirage."Why not," I finally answered.Our father had done wondrous things. His crowning achievement, the canal, had helped millions, even tens of millions and for generations. As I sat there beside Jennifer, my pride in him swelled. "Maybe," said Jennifer looking away, "we'll be stuck for the rest of our lives."I was suddenly thankful that for me an adult "lifetime" still lay ahead. But wasn't it like the sweat and mud that go into a piece of pottery? Only the final creation really matters. And the creation is happiness. So rare and precious. Someday I might just have it too! And if I didn't, what would it matter? My toil and suffering would be remnant dust. It would blow away in the wind, leaving only porcelain to reflect the light."When Dad was young," said Jennifer, "he was a lot like us, wasn't he?""What do you mean?" I said."He had a lot of disappointments.""Yeah. I guess."Jennifer was just beginning to take an interest in Father, not merely as someone who had tyrannized her in the past or could interfere with her lifestyle in the future but as an individual quite separate from herself. He had a history independent of ours. He had once been young.  He might soon die. She was finally beginning to see him.Two Skies     v(Tries to offer J. something more concrete.) shakes her head.

7#$H@a[RWRWHHHV4"88x< \*!Hr GChapter 9: ThunderheadWe finally arrived home early in the afternoon of the fifth day.  We parked in a small spit of gravel by the side garden of our cottage-like house and walked around to the front porch. Entering the foyer, I knocked on the door of the downstairs apartment.  These mundane acts brought me back to my first homecoming more than a year ago. When the door had opened then, Mother had greeted me.  All smiles but also quite self-composed, perhaps even detached. In a way, not really what I'd expected; afterall, it had been a long, long time. But that was the strength and serenity of Mother's character."What's taking him?" said Jennifer impatiently."He moves pretty slow these days."After a minute more Jennifer stormed out of the house, and I followed close behind. We went around to the backyard, and there, seated in a deep wooden lawn chair so familiar from childhood but now marked by scratches and peeling grey paint, was Father.  His hair and beard had a fresh-cut look to them, but his clothes were noticeably soiled.  And even out in the open air, our noses informed that he had not bathed in many days."Ba," Jennifer said barely able to conceal her disgust and rancor, "what are you doing out here?"His whole body seemed to shudder as his eyes opened. "Who's there?" he said fearfully. After a long moment he managed to muster the wherewithal or courage to look up."It's us," I said."We called from the motel this morning," said Jennifer. "Don't you remember?!"To his face came a smile, which soon soured into a frown of befuddlement and distress. "You," he said weakly. From his watery eyes ran tears, wetting his cheeks."That's okay," I said.Jennifer, half-frowning, put a hand on his shoulder for a second or two before putting them down by her sides again."I can't believe this," said Jennifer, shaking her head and scrubbing furiously at the stove top with a rusty wad of steel wool. "Just look at this!""Yeah," I agreed with deliberate casualness. I turned my attention back to the refrigerator, which I was ridding of moldy and rotten food. I quickly filled a plastic trash bag. Tying it nice and tight, I let it sag to the floor and then went to the dining room. "And where are you going?" called Jennifer. "The kitchen needs mopping!""Well, I can't very well mop with you standing there!"  I walked unharassed to the dark velvet curtains drawn across the dining room windows.  "Where did he ever get these things?" I asked myself as I drew one back, and sunlight cut into the room, exposing the layer of dust on the large oak table. Peering outside, I saw butterflies flitting among an unruly clutch of flowers. Their petals, pierced by light, glowed with dazzling color.Father's slow, heavy footsteps alerted me to his approach. "Amazing walls, huh?" I said to Jennifer. "We couldn't even hear the shower." Just as I wrote the Chinese character for our family name in the dust with my finger, Father emerged from the shadows of the adjoining bedroom.  Jennifer, arms crossed, stood at the kitchen entrance."Did you wash real well?" she asked with a scowl, undoubtedly noticing that he had put on his dirty clothes again. She looked to me, pursed her lips and, in what was apparently meant to be a low, private tone said rather loudly, "You should have supervised him." "I have something for you," said Father cheerfully, with unexpected verve."No," commanded Jennifer. "Go back and change into some clean clothes first.""Okay," said Father, and he trundled forth towards the kitchen. As Jennifer instinctively backed away, she said in a foreboding tone, "Daaad", but I gestured frantically for her hold her fire. Father led us to the stove."The stove's clean now," said Jennifer with restrained hostility."Wonderful," came the response. Leaning over, he pulled back the oven door and swung it all the way down.  Then he stepped back and motioned with a hand towards the roasting racks inside, the expression on his face one of unmistakable pride."What is it?" said Jennifer, almost afraid to look.  "I hope he didn't try cooking something."There on the racks, practically packing every cubic inch of available space, were glossy bags of cookies, pretzels and potato chips.  Decorative boxes of candies, cup cakes and small fruit pies.  The festive provisions were enough for a celebration of grand proportions, at least by the humble standards of our family.I pulled out a bag of chocolate chips, opened it and took out a cookie. Sampling it, I turned to Jennifer and mouthed the word "fresh"."Mother used to do this job," said Father softly in his faltering English. "But now that she is gone ... I take over." He quickly covered his face.Oddly, the sentimentality caught me by surprise. "Thanks Ba," I said and straightened up, hurriedly trying to come up with an appropriate response. Then, to my great surprise, Jennifer put an arm around Father's shoulders and said, "Thanks Ba....  You did a good job.""Yeah," I added.  The next thing I knew, she was guiding him back towards the bedrooms.  Gently she said, "Let's find some clean clothes." That evening we took Father out for dinner. He requested Hoss's steak house where senior citizens enjoyed a fifteen percent discount and there was an all-you-can-eat salad bar, which absolutely delighted him. That night we tucked him in beneath fresh sheets. Almost immediately, he seemed to slip to the verge of sleep. "Thank the sky you're home", he whispered."And I'm home to stay," I replied without thinking. "I won't be going off again."Struggling to stay awake, my old father forced open an eye but just a sliver. "What?" he said. "Why?""To help take care of you, of course."His lid slid shut again, but now a frown wrinkled his forehead. "No," he muttered with quiet urgency. "But I'm not ready to stop yet.... Promise me. Promise me.""What's he talking about?" asked Jennifer. "Promise him what?"I put a finger to my lips to hush her, not daring to stir another limb for fear of rousing him. Jennifer too sat stock still. But after what seemed a long time, the old man whispered yet again, "Promise."With great reluctance, I answered, "I promise," and after that, he was lost to the world.The next two days were spent cleaning the house and replenishing its shelves, doing the laundry and tending to minor household repairs. Some time was even spent in the yard. Jennifer mowed the lawn, and I weeded the garden.  When I'd finished, Father watered the flowers with a hose.  We saw to it that he didn't over tax himself, which wasn't difficult since he was naturally inclined to nap often and long.For me, this chore-packed holiday came to an end all too soon. After only a week at home, I caught a Greyhound bus for Boston, a city then in the midst of economic revival. Chris's brother, who was attending law school there, graciously allowed me to stay with him two days while scouting out job opportunities and waiting for my flight back to California.  I envied my sister that she didn't have to go, so it was with a heavy heart and tinsel sense of independence that I boarded the plane.When I got back to my share house in Menlo Park, I found two letters waiting for me on the kitchen counter. One was from the Berkeley school of business, the other from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. By its feel, the domestic-mail envelope obviously contained more than the single sheet one would expect of a rejection, so I opened it first. As I had deduced, it was an acceptance to the Berkeley MBA program! My ticket out and up! The thin airmail envelope could not have contained more than a single sheet, so I knew straight away what it was about. The proposal I had submitted to the Chinese Academy of Sciences was clearly preposterous; despite the countless long nights of research and formulation, my ideas were all wrong.  I left the letter unopened on the kitchen counter and went downstairs to unpack.That evening as I finished dinner in front of the living room TV, Jon called out to me from the kitchen. "Aren't you going to read this?""You mean the letter from China?" I said. "Why should I read what I've already read?""Huh?" said Jon. "But it's unopened.""You cleaning the counter or something?""No. You want me to toss it?"I squeezed the remote control in my hand; the screen image of young lions licking their blood-smeared chops and walking lazily away from a kill imploded to a dot of light."Wait a minute," I said, getting up out of my chair to deliver my plate and glass to the kitchen sink.  My tall housemate and dental flossing partner stood against the counter eating ice cream from a plastic bowl.  I picked up the envelope, ripped it open and pulled out the tissue-thin Chinese stationary. Clearing my throat, I read out loud, "Dear Dr. Zhou," pausing to smirk."'Dr. Zhou'," echoed Jon, grinning and scratching the side of his neck with the end of his spoon. "Wooo.""Thank you very much for your March thirty letter," I started again. "I am sorry for not writing back before, but I was away.  I return two days ago." Racing ahead with my eyes, I fell silent."What is it?" asked Jon."Shh," I said, quickly putting a finger to my mouth. I had to hear the words in my mind first:What you suggest is true. We ourselves are not clear how China has reversed desert expansion and develops its northern arid lands.  As you ask in your proposal "Is our victory permanent? Can development be sustained?" These are important questions for us. They are important maybe also to other people in the world who must deal with harsh conditions. Therefore, we would like to invite you to join us. We would like you to help us analyze the experience of our past.I stuffed my bedding into plastic trash bags and sealed my books, tools and cooking utensils into cardboard boxes. All of these things were stored in the share house basement, for if my postdoc in China failed to lead anywhere, I would return to California for the M.B.A.  For now though, it was back to Pennsylvania and a summer of preparation. A great challenge lay ahead.One early June morning Jon and I loaded our sleeping bags and backpacks into my Honda and quickly prepared to depart. None of our four housemates were on hand to bid us farewell, and Jon, who would be returning in a few weeks from his vacation road trip, didn't seem to feel particularly nostalgic. I must say that I really didn't either, but something kept me lingering on the porch of this house that had seen so many events and non-events, this house of my hopes, this house I had haunted. I simply stood there, in a half trance. "It's time to go," I finally told myself and began to pull my heart away.  But before I could take one step, a strange metallic sound from close to my feet arrested my motion.  At the bottom of the door, I saw the black and white cat brushing its body against the wire screen. I lifted my head, and there was Anka, staring at me through a metal haze."You're up early," I said."I didn't sleep," she replied."Then you must be tired."Slowly, the crooked smile spread across her face.  "I had a strange dream last night. Someone was chasing me, and then he caught me. He made me stick my head in a guillotine." Her face was pale and gaunt; her frame was almost skeletal. "Then he pulled the handle, and the blade came down on my neck. But it only cut halfway through, so he started pushing down on the top of the blade.  I could feel it cutting into my neck.  It was very slow. I felt it slice through the bone and press against my windpipe, then it cut through that too. I couldn't breath and the pain was terrible, more terrible than a thousand needles pressing into my body. I was dead. And you, Chichkou, were my executioner. You watched the blood pour out of my headless body, and when you got bored, you took my head and sewed it back onto the stump of my neck. Then it all started over again. I ran, you caught me, you forced me to put my head in the guillotine."I stood there transfixed, unable to find a single word of denial or defense. When finally I could bear it no longer, I said, "I'm so sorry.""For what?" she said. "Bad dream?""Take care of yourself! Be careful!""No, Chich-kou. You  be careful."I lowered my eyes, nodding in shame."Just joking," she said. "The man of my dream wasn't you. Someone else. Taller, maybe." She laughed. "Better sense of humor."Since our promising beginning of the highway rescue, we had gone backwards, a long way."It was probably my ex." She looked down and dipped her head.  "Yeah," she said.  "Take care.""Thank you, Anka. Thank you for everything.""Forget it," she answered softly. "Bye bye."  She turned and almost seemed to float away. I turned as well and descended the steps.The dawn of our third morning out found us barreling down the eastern flank of the Colorado Rockies and shooting across the Mid-western plains.  As the day progressed, the temperature and humidity rose steadily.  By Nebraska, milkshake stops could no longer soothe the pain in Jon's lower back.  So crossing a bridge over the North Platte River, we parked the car and scampered down the embankment. Stripping naked and wading into the waist-deep water, we lay on our backs and floated with nothing pressing us except the sultry sky.Jon's back condition seemed to improve after the break, which permitted us to pick up the pace. By ten o'clock at night we were in far-eastern Iowa closing in on the Mississippi.  We could easily have made Illinois before stopping for the day, but the sky threatened us with every silent flash of lightening that surged through the bowels of a gathering storm. Instead, we turned off the main highway a few miles before the great river and snuck onto a wildlife sanctuary.At the edge of a stand of towering elms, we pitched my one-man tent. Since the trees afforded an illusion of protection from the violent sky, we lay at the tent's opening and watched the dry storm across an open field, listening to its titanic rumble.  Being a California boy born and bred, Jon had never before seen lightening; it fascinated him. Then when fireflies began to blink around the tent, he became positively giddy and raced out to catch them with his hands. A talon of lightning ripped the sky; a deafening clap shook the earth, and Jon dove back into the tent."Wow!" he said. "What was that?""Thunder," I informed my friend.Soon the lightening filled half the sky with white-hot tributaries, and Jon had to work up his courage before each mad dash for fireflies. When it began to rain, he satisfied himself with watching the storm from our shelter."You know how I'm going to go?" I said above the noise of the storm."What do you mean? " asked Jon. "You mean how you're going to die?  Like electrocution or something?"Rolling onto my back, I used my arms for pillow and had the low ceiling of our nylon cocoon as view. "No," I said. "I meant the way I'm going to go back to China.""Ohhh," said Jon. "How?""I'm going to hitchhike across Europe.""I thought you said China.""And then from Italy or Greece I'm going to catch a cheap flight to India.""Ahhh."I closed my eyes and found myself standing at the edge of a great cliff, my head pulled back, screaming at the sky like a hawk ready to launch, to press its wings against the pliantly solid air. Lifted, lifted by sheer joy and power."From India, I'll go to Pakistan, and in Pakistan I'll go up into the mountains. I'll go up and up and up until I reach a pass at seventeen thousand feet called Karakorum. One more step, and I'll be back in China.""Wow," said Jon. "You can do that?""Don't know, but I'm going to try."Long ago, Father had come to this country where society or "lifestyle" or "self" consumes souls, and I was headed for his land where people had once fed upon each other. While my new adventure could easily devour me in conflicts and entanglements, fresh failures and disappointments, the wild storm that swallowed a small tent whole with two young men inside offered strange solace.  I sensed that the answer I sought lie east of Karakorum, perhaps in the desolation of China's remote Far West, perhaps in a place and time beyond that. Or maybe there wouldn't be a "place and time", and the tide would turn imperceptibly in smooth, gradual rises. My future would form around me, growing up from the ground like corn in a field or trees in the forest.  Centuries ago Tang Zeng journeyed to India to fetch the scriptures of Buddha for the enlightenment of his homeland. I now looked ahead to an eastward pilgrimage to attain an earthly salvation for a displaced, discombobulated family.  Along the way, my odyssey might offer trophies in the form of small exploits and victories, which Father would place on his mind's mantle to savor with pride. My success would be his success; my life would give him life. Through me he would go on. I loved my father despite the past, and someday I would teach my children well the lessons he had never fully mastered. Suddenly it did dawn on me: I had already forgiven Erin our once future forever lost. She had taught me the most difficult and valuable lesson of them all: sacrifice. Closing my eyes, I saw her as she was again before the descent of sleeplessness, sitting at the kitchen table, bathed in sunlight, her face open, her smile blithe.Tugging gently at the nylon cord around my neck, I pulled Mother's golden ring up from beneath my shirt collar. Tasting the cool sweet metal between my lips, I realized she was still not with me, but in an entirely different sense, I was now with her. My heart, my soul had drawn closer to hers: grown wiser, braver.Jon and I talked on into the early morning hours. Between snippets of conversation, I daydreamed about the Milky Way spilled across the night sky.  Its stars appeared to me through the tent's fabric ceiling, through the tops of the trees and through the thunderhead that capped the sky. When I became too drowsy, neither words, the storm or the stars could hold back sleep, and it washed over me like the warm tide of a benevolent sea.Two Skies     v "That's okay.
